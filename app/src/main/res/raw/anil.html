    In the mid-1970s, he began
trading in scrap metal, collecting it from cable companies in other states and 
selling it in Mumbai.In 1976, Anil Agarwal acquired Shamsher Sterling 
Corporation, a manufacturer of enameled copper, among other products, with a 
bank loan. For the next 10 years, he ran both businesses.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

    In 1986, he set up a factory
to manufacture jelly-filled cables, creating Sterlite Industries. He soon 
realized that the profitability of his business was volatile, fluctuating with 
the prices of his raw materials: copper and aluminium. So he decided to control 
his input costs by manufacturing the metals instead of buying them.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    In 1993, Sterlite Industries
became the first private sector company in India to set up a copper smelter and 
refiner In 1995, Sterlite Industries acquired Madras Aluminium, a ‘sick’ company 
that had been shut down for 4 years and held by the Board for Industrial and 
Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).The next step of the backward integration 
process seemed natural: mining.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    His first opportunity came
when the government announced a disinvestment program. In 2001, he acquired 51 
percent in Bharat Aluminium Company (BALCO), a public sector undertaking; in the 
very next year, he acquired a majority stake (nearly 65 per cent) in state-run 
HZL. Both the companies were considered sleepy and inefficient mining firms.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    To access international
capital markets, Anil Agarwal and his team incorporated Vedanta Resources Plc in 
2003. At the time of its listing, Vedanta Resources Plc, was the first Indian 
firm to be listed on London Stock Exchange, on December 10, 2003,Vedanta 
Resources became the parent company of the group through a process of internal 
restructuring of group companies and their shareholding.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    In 2004 Vedanta Resources
Plc announced a global bond offering and acquired Konkola Copper Mines in 
Zambia, Africa.In 2007, Vedanta Resources acquired a controlling stake in Sesa 
Goa Limited, India’s largest producer-exporter of iron ore,[18] and in 2010, the 
company acquired South African miner Anglo American’s portfolio of zinc assets 
in Namibia, Ireland and South Africa. The next year, Vedanta Resources acquired 
controlling stake in Cairn India, India’s largest private sector oil-producing 
firm. The merger of Sesa Goa and Sterlite Industries was announced in 2012, as 
part of the Vedanta Group’s consolidation.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Vedanta Resources,
headquartered in London, is a globally diversified natural resources 
conglomerate, with interests in zinc, lead, silver, copper, iron ore, aluminium, 
power generation, and oil and gas. The greatest share of its assets, however, is 
in India; Agarwal lives in London, but as he has reiterated often, his heart and 
soul are in India. His philanthropic activities are targeted at eradicating 
poverty, by creating jobs and contributing to India’s GDP growth through his 
business operations.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    In 2004, a committee of the
Indian Supreme Court charged that Vedanta had dumped thousands of tons of 
arsenic-bearing slag near its factory in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, 
resulting in major poisoning of the environment and neighbouring population. In 
2005, another committee of the Indian Supreme Court charged that Vedanta had 
forced over one hundred indigenous families from their homes in the Indian state 
of Odisha, where it sought to mine bauxite. <br/><br/>According to the committee's report,
“An atmosphere of fear was created through the hired goons,” and residents were 
“beaten up by the employees of M/s Vedanta.” Vedanta’s actions in Odisha were 
rebuked by the British commerce agency, and the Church of England investment 
funds sold their shares in the company in protest. In Zambia, Vedanta dumped 
hazardous waste into the Kafue River, from its copper mine there, according to a 
lawsuit filed by 2,000 residents, resulting in widespread human illness and the 
death of fish.<br/><br/> A local judge stated, "This was lack of corporate responsibility
and criminal, and a tipping point for corporate recklessness.” In 2014, an audit 
was begun by Zambian officials due to suspicions that Vedanta has not been 
paying its proper fees to the government. In addition, "hundreds of former mine 
workers are fighting Vedanta for severance or disability pay</span></span></p>
