	John Jacob Astor (July 17, 1763 – March 29, 1848),
born Johann Jakob Astor, was a German American businessman, merchant, real 
estate mogul and investor who mainly made his fortune in fur trade and by 
investing in real estate in or around New York City.<br/><br/>

Born in Germany, Astor emigrated to England as a
teenager and worked as a musical instrument manufacturer. He moved to the United 
States after the American Revolutionary War. He entered the fur trade and built 
a monopoly, managing a business empire that extended to the Great Lakes region 
and Canada, and later expanded into the American West and Pacific coast. Seeing 
the decline of demand, he got out of the fur trade in 1830, diversifying by 
investing in New York City real estate and later becoming a famed patron of the 
arts.<br/><br/>

Johann Jakob Astor was born in Walldorf near
Heidelberg in the old Palatinate. He was the youngest son of Johann Jakob Astor 
(July 7, 1724 – April 18, 1816) and Maria Magdalena Vorfelder (1730–1766).His 
three elder brothers were Georg Peter (later "George"; April 28, 1752 – December 
3, 1813), Heinrich (later Henry; 1754–1833), and Melchior (1759–1829). Astor's 
father was a butcher. Johann first worked in his father's shop and as a dairy 
salesman.In 1779, at the age of 16, he moved to London to join his brother 
George in working for an uncle's piano and flute manufactory, Astor &amp; Broadwood. 
While there, he learned English and anglicized his name<br/><br/>

In 1783 or March 1784,Astor immigrated to New York
City, just following the end of the American Revolution, He rented a room from 
Sarah Cox Todd, a widow and began a flirtation with his landlady's daughter, 
Sara Cox Todd. His intent was to join his brother Henry, who had established a 
butcher shop there, but a chance meeting with a fur trader on his voyage 
inspired him to join the North American fur trade as well.<br/><br/> After working at his
brother's shop for a time he began to purchase raw hides from Native Americans, 
prepare them himself, and then resell them in London and elsewhere at great 
profit. He opened his own fur goods shop in New York in the late 1780s and also 
served as the New York agent of his uncle's musical instrument business.</span></p>
