	Nikola Tesla (Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла; 10
July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical 
engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist best known for his 
contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity 
supply system.<br/><br/>

Tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical
engineering before emigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas 
Edison in New York City. He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, 
setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices. 
His patented AC induction motor and transformer were licensed by George 
Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla for a short time as a consultant. His work in 
the formative years of electric-power development was involved in a corporate 
alternating current/direct current "War of Currents" as well as various patent 
battles. He became a naturalized US citizen in 1891.<br/><br/>

Tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting
and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power 
experiments in New York and Colorado Springs and made early (1893) 
pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. He 
tried to put these ideas to practical use in an ill-fated attempt at 
intercontinental wireless transmission, his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower 
project.In his lab, he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical 
oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He 
also built a wireless controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited.<br/><br/>

Tesla was renowned for his achievements and
showmanship, eventually earning him a reputation in popular culture as an 
archetypal "mad scientist". His patents earned him a considerable amount of 
money, much of which was used to finance his own projects with varying degrees 
of success.He lived most of his life in a series of New York hotels through his 
retirement. Tesla died on 7 January 1943 in New York City. His work fell into 
relative obscurity after his death, but in 1960, the General Conference on 
Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his 
honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.<br/><br/>

Tesla was born on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 into a
Serb family in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia).His 
father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879), was an Orthodox priest. <br/><br/>Tesla's mother, Đuka
Tesla (née Mandić; 1822–1892), whose father was also an Orthodox priest, had a 
talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to 
memorize Serbian epic poems.<br/><br/> Đuka had never received a formal education. Nikola
credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and 
influence. Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Monteneg

Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had an older
brother, Dane, and three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica. Dane was killed in 
a horse-riding accident when Nikola was aged five. In 1861 Tesla attended the 
"Lower" or "primary" school in Smiljan, where he studied German, arithmetic, and 
religion. <br/><br/>In 1862 the Tesla family moved to Gospić, Austrian Empire, where
Tesla's father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed "lower" or "primary" 
school, followed by the "lower real gymnasium" or "normal school"</span></p>
