    Blair was raised in Southern
California.As an adolescent, Blair suffered from Attention Deficit Disorder and 
struggled with his father’s violent behavior and addiction to methamphetamines. 
He dropped out of high school in the 9th grade, left home, and became a gang&nbsp; 
member in his home-town of Los Angeles. He lived in a toolshed for a year and 
was arrested 10 times by the time he was sixteen, facing a four-year jail 
sentence for his last arrest. When he was 18, Blair’s mother began dating a 
successful real-estate entrepreneur who became Blair’s mentor and gave him his 
first job at Logix Development, a computer technical support provider. At age 
21, after serving as vice president of Logix Development he founded the 
technical-support firm 24/7 Tech.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    In 2005 Blair became the CEO
of the multi-level marketing company ViSalus Sciences. In 2008, ViSalus was in 
debt and facing bankruptcy. That year the company was acquired by Blyth Inc., 
with Blair remaining as CEO. Within 16 months the company went from $6 million 
in debt to $150 million in revenue. As of 2012, ViSalus was valued at $600 
million. Revenue subsequently declined and the company operated at a loss for 
2013 and the first two quarters of 2014.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
