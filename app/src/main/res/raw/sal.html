founded the Khan Academy, a free online education platform and an organization 
with which he has produced over 6,500 video lessons teaching a wide spectrum of 
academic subjects, mainly focusing on mathematics and sciences.<br />
<br />
As of October 2016, the Khan Academy channel on YouTube has more than 2.8 
million subscribers and the Khan Academy videos have been viewed more than 840 
million times.In 2012, Time named Salman Khan in its annual list of the 100 most 
influential people in the world. Forbes magazine featured Khan on its cover with 
the story "$1 Trillion Opportunity.<br/><br/>
alman Khan was born to Muslim parents in Metairie, Louisiana. His father, Dr. 
Fakhrul Amin Khan, is from Barisal, Bangladesh and his mother, Masuda Khan, is 
from Murshidabad, West Bengal, India.<br />
<br />
Khan attended the public school Grace King High School in Metairie, Louisiana, 
where, as he recalls, "a few classmates were fresh out of jail and others were 
bound for top universities."<br />
<br />
Khan was motivated even at a young age to help other people learn.<br />
<br />
Khan attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with 
Bachelor of Science degrees in mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer 
science in 1998, later getting his Master of Science in electrical engineering 
and computer science. Khan was class president in his senior year.<br />
<br />
Khan also holds a Master in Business Administration from Harvard Business 
School.
<br />
<br />
In 2002, Khan was a summer intern at PARC. From 2003 to late 2009, Khan worked 
as a hedge fund analyst at Connective Capital Management.<br />
<br />
In late 2003, Khan began tutoring his cousin, Nadia, in mathematics over the 
internet using Yahoo!'s Doodle notepad. When other relatives and friends sought 
his tutoring, he moved his tutorials to YouTube where he created an account on 
November 16, 2006.<br />
<br />
The popularity of his educational videos on the video-sharing website prompted 
Khan to quit his job as a financial analyst in late 2009. He moved his focus to 
developing his YouTube channel, Khan Academy, full-time with the aid of close 
friend Josh Gefner. Khan consequently received sponsorship from Ann Doerr, the 
wife of John Doerr.<br />
<br />
His videos received worldwide interest from both students and non-students, with 
more than 458 million views in the first number of years.<br />
<br />
Khan outlined his mission as to "accelerate learning for students of all ages. 
With this in mind, we want to share our content with whoever may find it 
useful." Khan plans to extend the "free school" to cover topics such as English. 
Khan's videos are also used to educate rural areas of Africa and Asia.<br />
<br />
Khan published a book about Khan Academy and education goals titled The One 
World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined.<br />
<br />
Khan Academy, initially a tool for students, added the Coach feature in 2012, 
promoting the connection of teachers with students through videos and monitor 
tools.</p>
