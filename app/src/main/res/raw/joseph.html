	Seligman was born in Baiersdorf, Germany. As a
small child, he worked in his mother's dry goods shop. Present-day Germany 
consisted of many independent states in the early 19th century, most of which 
issued their own, differing coinages; and young Joseph made a profit at his 
mother's store changing money for travelers for a small fee.<br/><br/> Joseph's father
wanted him to enter the family wool business, but circumstances made this 
difficult; in particular, migration of the peasant class (Seligman's father's 
customers) from rural areas to urban meant a loss of job opportunities and a 
shrinking economic base in Baiersdorf.<br/><br/> At fourteen, Seligman attended the
University of Erlangen. At seventeen, he boarded a steamer at Bremen and sailed 
to America.<br/><br/>

Arriving in the United States at age 18, Seligman
initially settled in Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, where he went to work as a 
cashier/clerk for Asa Packer, who later become a United States congressman. His 
salary was $400 a year. <br/><br/>Using his savings from work, Seligman began selling
goods door to door in rural Pennsylvania (jewelry, knives, smaller goods), 
saving outlying farmers the trouble of coming into town to buy their goods. 
After saving $500, Seligman was able to send to Germany for his brothers William 
and James, who joined him in peddling.<br/><br/>The Seligmans encountered some antisemitic abuse in
their interactions with Americans, though they were not discouraged from 
continuing to sell.<br/><br/>

Joseph Seligman and his brothers owned and operated
several stores in Alabama, but they became uncomfortable with the institution of 
slavery in the South. Additionally, the rest of the family had emigrated to New 
York, leading the brothers to move north and establish J. Seligman and Brothers.<br/><br/>
Jesse Seligman ran the store's branch in San Francisco, while Joseph managed the 
New York City store. Despite the economic booms and busts of the 1850s and 
1860s, J. Seligman and Brothers remained prosperous.<br/><br/>

During the American Civil War, Seligman was
responsible for aiding the Union by disposing of $200,000,000 in bonds "a feat 
which W. E. Dodd said was 'scarcely less important than the Battle of 
Gettysburg.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Later historians have suggested that Seligman's role
in financing the war through bonds has been exaggerated. According to Stephen 
Birmingham, Seligman was obliged to accept 7.30 bonds from the government as 
payment for the uniforms his factory was delivering. Union defeats, combined 
with a suspiciously high interest rate, lowered confidence in the bonds, making 
them difficult to sell.<br/><br/>

In the post-Civil War Gilded Age, J. &amp; W. Seligman &amp;
Co. invested heavily in railroad finance, in particular acting as broker of 
transactions engineered by Jay Gould.<br/><br/> They underwrote the securities of a
variety of companies, participating in stock and bond issues in the railroad and 
steel and wire industries, investments in Russia and Peru, the formation of the 
Standard Oil Company, and shipbuilding, bridges, bicycles, mining, and a variety 
of other industries.<br/><br/> Later, in 1876, the Seligmans joined forces with the
Vanderbilt family to create public utilities in New York. In 1877, Seligman was 
involved in the most publicized antisemitic incident in American history up to 
that point, being denied entry into the Grand Union Hotel in Saratoga Springs, 
New York by Henry Hilton.</span></p>
