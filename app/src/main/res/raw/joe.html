    Blackman began planning events when he was thirteen years old, helping out on
events at a local community centre before starting his first business while in 
university studying a BA degree in Stage Management at the Royal Welsh College

In 2005, Blackman founded Collection 26, an event-planning company. He was 20 
years old. Venture Wales, a business-support project of the Welsh government, 
supported Blackman's efforts with business advice.<br />

Blackman plans parties and weddings for royalty, celebrities, and corporate 
customers. Following successful events in Abu Dhabi, he expanded Collection 26 
to service customers in the Middle East in 2010.<br />
