    Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname
reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal&nbsp; 
upon the family's immigration to the United States.The son of Lorraine Charlotte 
(née Langfan), a stockbroker, and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell 
attended Herod Elementary School in Houston. In a bid to enter business early, 
he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early 
teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious 
metals.<br />
<br />
Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early 
teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at 
Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly 
disassembled to see how it worked.<br/><br/> Dell attended Memorial High School in
Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making 
cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were 
those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence; 
he then targeted this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and 
mortgage applications. <br/><br/>Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual
income of his history and economics teacher.While a freshman pre-med student at 
the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and 
selling upgrade kits for personal computers in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center 
residential building. <br/><br/>He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts
for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer 
store.<br />
In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings 
of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the 
conventional indirect retail channel. <br/><br/>In January 1984, Dell registered his
company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold 
between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In 
May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated 
it to a business center in North Austin.<br/><br/> The company employed a few order
takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a 
manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at 
six-foot tables". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.<br />
<br />
In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune 
magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.<br/><br/> In 1996, Dell started selling
computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. 
Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com. In the 
first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, 
passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker.<br/><br/> The metric marked the
first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's 
combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent 
worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's 
sales were shrinking.<br />
<br />
In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. 
Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity 
activities, and real estate. <br/><br/>The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New
York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day 
operations.On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of 
Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president 
and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, 
succeeding Rollins.</p>
