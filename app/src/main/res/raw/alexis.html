grassroots campaign that eventually overturned the two bills. Ohanian spoke to 
members of Congress, helped launch the national anti-SOPA/PIPA protests that

embarked on the Internet 2012 Bus Tour from Denver, CO to Danville, KY to

Geek Day." in Washington DC.<br />

thanks to platforms like Kickstarter."<br />
