Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata&nbsp;(3 March 1839&nbsp;– 19 May 1904) was an Indian 
pioneer&nbsp;industrialist, who founded the&nbsp;Tata Group, India's biggest conglomerate 
company. He was born to a&nbsp;Parsi&nbsp;Zoroastrian&nbsp;family in&nbsp;Navsarithen part of 
the&nbsp;princely state&nbsp;of&nbsp;Baroda.<br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
He founded what would later become the&nbsp;Tata Group&nbsp;of companies. Tata is regarded 
as the legendary "Father of Indian Industry".<br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
"When you have to give the lead in action, in ideas&nbsp;– a lead which does not fit 
in with the very climate of opinion&nbsp;– that is true courage, physical or mental 
or spiritual, call it what you like, and it is this type of courage and vision 
that Jamsedji Tata showed. It is right that we should honour his memory and 
remember him as one of the big founders of modern India." —Jawaharlal 
NehruJamsetji Nusserwanji Tata was born to Nusserwanji and Jeevanbai Tata on 3 
March 1839 in&nbsp;Navsari, a city in south&nbsp;Gujarat. His father, Nusserwanji, was the 
first businessman in a family of&nbsp;Parsi&nbsp;Zoroastrian&nbsp;priests. He broke the 
tradition to become the first member of the family to try his hand at business. 
He started an export trading firm in&nbsp;Mumbai.<br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
Jamsetji Tata joined his father in Mumbai at the age of 14 and enrolled at 
the&nbsp;Elphinstone College&nbsp;completing his education as a 'Green Scholar' 
(equivalent of a graduate). He was married to Hirabai Daboo&nbsp;while he was still a 
student.&nbsp;He graduated from college in 1858 and joined his father's trading firm. 
It was a turbulent time to step into business as the&nbsp;Indian Rebellion of 
1857&nbsp;had just been suppressed by the British government.<br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
Tata made many trips abroad, mainly to England,&nbsp;America, Europe, China, and 
Japan to establish branches for his father's business.<br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
Tata worked in his father's company until he was 29. He founded a trading 
company in 1868 with&nbsp;21,000 capital (worth&nbsp;52 million in 2015 prices). He bought 
a bankrupt oil mill at&nbsp;Chinchpokli&nbsp;in 1869 and converted it to a cotton mill, 
which he renamed&nbsp;Alexandra Mill. He sold the mill two years later for a profit. 
He set up another cotton mill at&nbsp;Nagpur&nbsp;in 1874, which he christened&nbsp;Empress 
Mill&nbsp;when&nbsp;Queen Victoria&nbsp;was proclaimed Empress of India on 1 January 1877.<br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
He had four goals in life: setting up an iron and steel company, a world-class 
learning institution, a unique hotel and a hydro-electric plant. Only the hotel 
became a reality during his lifetime, with the inauguration of the&nbsp;Taj Mahal 
Hotel&nbsp;at&nbsp;Colaba&nbsp;waterfront in&nbsp;Mumbai&nbsp;on 3 December 1903 at the cost of&nbsp;₹11 
million (worth&nbsp;₹11 billion in 2015 prices). At that time it was the only hotel 
in&nbsp;India&nbsp;to have electricity.<br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
His successors' work led to the three remaining ideas being achieved:<br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
Tata Steel&nbsp;(formerly TISCO&nbsp;– Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited)(Jamshedji was 
its founder) is Asia's first and India's largest steel company. It became 
world's fifth largest steel company, after it acquired Corus Group producing 
28&nbsp;million tonnes of steel annually.Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, the 
pre-eminent Indian institution for research and education in Science and 
Engineering.Tata Hydroelectric Power Supply Company, renamed&nbsp;Tata Power&nbsp;Company 
Limited, currently India's largest private electricity company with an installed 
generation capacity of over 8000MW.</p>
