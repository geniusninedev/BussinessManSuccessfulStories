"An entrepreneur is born with the mentality to take
risks, though there are several important characteristics: courage, faith in 
yourself, and above all, even when you fail, to learn from failure and get up 
and try again."<br/><br/>

In the late 1970s, Adelson and his partners developed
the computer trade show COMDEX, for the computer industry; the first show was in 
1979. It was the premier computer trade show through much of the 1980s and 
1990s.<br/><br/>

In 2007, Adelson made an unsuccessful bid to purchase
the Israeli newspaper Maariv. When this failed, he proceeded with parallel plans 
to publish a free daily newspaper to compete with Israeli, a newspaper he had 
co-founded in 2006 but had left.<br/><br/>The first edition of the new newspaper, Israel
Hayom, was published on July 30, 2007. On March 31, 2014, Adelson received the 
go-ahead from a Jerusalem court to purchase Maariv and the conservative 
newspaper Makor Rishon. In 2016 Adelson's attorney announced that he does not 
own Israel Hayom, it is owned by a relative of his.<br/><br/>

<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
According to a Target Group Index (TGI) survey
published in July 2011, Israel Hayom, which unlike all other Israeli newspapers 
is distributed for free, became the number-one daily newspaper (on weekdays) 
four years after its inception.<br/><br/> This survey found that Israel Hayom had a
39.3% weekday readership exposure, Yedioth Ahronoth 37%, Maariv 12.1%, and 
Haaretz 5.8%. The Yedioth Ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a 
44.3% readership exposure, compared to 31% for the Israel Hayom weekend edition, 
14.9% for Maariv, and 6.8% for Haaretz. This trend was already observed by a TGI 
survey in July 2010.<br/><br/>

In 2011, the Israeli press said that Adelson was
unhappy with coverage of him on Israeli Channel 10, which alleged that Adelson 
had acquired a casino license in Las Vegas inappropriately through political 
connections. <br/><br/>The channel apologized after Adelson threatened a lawsuit. This led
to the resignations of the news chief, Reudor Benziman; the news editor, Ruti 
Yuval; and the news anchor, Guy Zohar, who objected to the apology.<br/><br/>After two
months of deliberations, the Israeli Second Authority for Television and Radio 
ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had 
been conducted, the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate.</span></p>
