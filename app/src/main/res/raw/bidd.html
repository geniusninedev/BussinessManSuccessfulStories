Biddy Mason was born a slave on August 15, 1818, in
Georgia She was given the name of "Bridget" with no surname and was given to 
Robert Smith and his bride as a wedding present. After the marriage, Smith took 
his new wife and slaves to Mississippi.<br/><br/>

Missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints (Mormon) proselytized in Mississippi. They taught Smith and 
his wealthy family and they converted. Slaves were not baptized in the church as 
a matter of policy. Members were encouraged to free their slaves,[citation 
needed] but Smith chose not to do so.<br/><br/>

The Smith household joined a group of other church
members from Mississippi to meet the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois, in 
1847. The group traveled to Pueblo, Colorado, and joined up with the sick 
detachment from the Mormon Battalion. They later joined the main body of Mormons 
crossing the plains and settled in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory.<br/><br/>

Church leader Brigham Young sent a group of Mormons to
Southern California in 1851. Robert Smith, his family, and his slaves joined 
them in San Bernardino, California, sometime later. Bridget was among a large 
group of slaves in the San Bernardino settlement. As part of the Compromise of 
1850, California was admitted as a free state and any slave who resided in the 
state or was born in the state was free. Bridget had lived in California for 
four years and some of the other slaves had been born in California, so they 
were covered by the law.Bridget wanted to be free,but was under the control of 
Robert Smith and ignorant of the laws and her rights.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
In 1856, Smith decided to move to the slave state of
Texas and sell his slaves there. He told his slaves that they would be free in 
Texas, but Bridget did not believe him. She did not want to go to Texas and was 
worried she would be separated from her children like she was from her mother.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Bridget, helped by friends, attempted to escape from
Smith. She and a group of Smith's other slaves traveled towards Los Angeles 
before Smith caught up with them. He took her and the other slaves and camped in 
canyon near Santa Monica. One of his slaves, Hannah, was having a baby which 
made it difficult to travel. Lizzy Flake Rowan, who had also been kept in 
slavery with Biddy in San Bernardino but had since been set free, told Frank 
Dewitt, the sheriff of Los Angeles county, of Smith's plans (David W. Alexand 
was actually the sheriff of Los Angeles). He issued a writ of habeas corpus and 
sent a local posse, who caught up with Smith and took the slaves into protective 
custody.<br/><br/>

Bridget petitioned a Los Angeles court for her
freedom. Smith claimed that Bridget was her family and she wanted to go to 
Texas.He then bribed her lawyer to not show up.She was not allowed to testify in 
court, since California law prohibited black people from testifying against 
white people. The judge presiding over the case, Benjamin Ignatius Hayes, 
interviewed Bridget and found she did not want to go to Texas and granted her 
freedom as a resident of a free state,as well as the freedom of the other slaves 
held captive by Smith (Bridget's three daughters—Ellen, Ann, and Harriet—and ten 
other African-American women and children). In 1860, Mason received a certified 
copy of the document that guaranteed her freedom<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Bridget had no legal last name as a slave. After
emancipation, she chose to be known as Bridget Biddy Mason. Mason was the middle 
name of Amasa Lyman, Mormon apostle and mayor of San Bernardino.[citation 
needed] Biddy had spent many years in the company of Lyman's household.<br/><br/>

After becoming free, she worked in Los Angeles as a
nurse and midwife. One of her employers was the noted physician John Strother 
Griffin. Saving carefully, she was one of the first African Americans to 
purchase land in the city. As a businesswoman, she amassed a relatively large 
fortune of nearly $300,000, which she shared generously with charities. Mason 
also fed and sheltered the poor, and visited prisoners. She was instrumental in 
founding a traveler's aid center, and an elementary school for black children. 
Because of her kind and giving spirit, many called her "Auntie Mason" or 
"Grandma Mason."<br/><br/>

In 1872, Mason was a founding member of First African
Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, the city's first black church. The 
organizing meetings were held in her home on Spring Street.[citation needed] She 
donated the land on which the church was built. This land is now the site of 
Biddy Mason Park, a Los Angeles city park and site of an art installation 
describing her life.<br/><br/>

Mason spoke fluent Spanish and was a well-known figure
in the city. She dined on occasion at the home of Pio Pico, the last governor of 
Alta California and a wealthy Los Angeles land owner.<br/><br/><strong>Death and posthumous honors:</strong><br/><br/>After Mason's death on January 15, 1891, she was
buried in an unmarked grave in Boyle Heights. On March 27, 1988, in a ceremony 
attended by the mayor of Los Angeles and members of the church she founded, the 
grave was marked with a tombstone.</span><br/><br/>

of Distinction. She was also celebrated on Biddy Mason Day on November 16, 1989.<br/><br/>

One of artist Sheila Levrant de Bretteville's
best-known pieces is "Biddy Mason's Place: A Passage of Time,”an 82-foot 
concrete wall with embedded objects in downtown Los Angeles (near where Mason 
lived) that tells the story of Mason's life</span></p>
