It was in 1969 that Dr. Karsanbhai Patel started Nirma and went on to create a 
whole new segment in the Indian domestic detergent market. During that time the 
domestic detergent market only had the premium segment and there were very few 
companies , mainly the MNCs, which were into this business.<br/><br/>Karsanbhai Patel used
to make detergent powder in the backyard of his house in Ahmedabad and then 
carry out door to door selling of his hand made product. <br/><br/>He gave a money back
guarantee with every pack that was sold. Karsanbhai Patel managed to offer his 
detergent powder for Rs. 3 per kg when the cheapest detergent at that time was 
Rs.13 per kg and so he was able to successfully target the middle and lower 
middle income segment.<br/><br/></p>
