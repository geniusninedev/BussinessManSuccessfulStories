Spreckels was born in Lamstedt, Hanover, now a city of
Germany. In 1846, he left his homeland to start a new life in the United States, 
with only one German thaler in his pocket. In 1852 he married his childhood 
sweetheart, Anna Christina Mangels (1829-1910), who had immigrated to New York 
City with her brother three years earlier.<br/><br/> They had thirteen children, five of
whom lived to maturity: John Diedrich (1853-1926), Adolph Bernard (1857-1924), 
Claus August (1858-1946), Rudolph (1872-1958) and daughter, Emma C. (Spreckels) 
m. Watson Ferris Hutton.<br/><br/>

The family first settled in South Carolina, where
Spreckels opened a grocery store business. Within a short time they moved to New 
York City, then in 1856 relocated to San Francisco, where Spreckels began a 
brewery. Spreckels entered the sugar business in the mid-1860s and came to 
dominate the Hawaiian sugar trade on the West Coast.<br/><br/> His first refinery, built
in 1867, was at Eighth and Brannan Streets in San Francisco, but by the late 
1870s the Brannan Street facilities were running at capacity, so Spreckels chose 
a site in Potrero Point to open a larger sugar refinery with water access.He 
called his concerns the California Sugar Refinery.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Spreckels used some of his wealth to purchase,
beginning in 1872, the former Mexican land grant Rancho Aptos, a large tract of 
ranch and timber land in Aptos, California. He built a large resort hotel and, 
not far away, an extensive ranch complex.<br/><br/> Spreckels was one of the original
investors in the Santa Cruz Railroad, which began operation in 1875 and passed 
through his land on its run between Santa Cruz and Watsonville.The narrow-gauge 
line was later acquired and converted to standard-gauge by the Southern Pacific 
Railroad, now part of the Union Pacific Railroad. <br/><br/>It was on the Aptos ranch that
Spreckels began to experiment with growing sugar beets. He induced others in the 
area to plant sugar beets as well,and built a small refinery in nearby Capitola 
in 1874, where it operated for five years.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
In 1888, Spreckels established the Western Beet Sugar
Company in Watsonville, which was at that time the largest beet sugar factory in 
the U.S.By 1890, Spreckels main growing operations had shifted to the Salinas 
Valley, so he built the 42-mile narrow gauge Pajaro Valley Consolidated Railroad 
to ship his sugar beets from the fields near Salinas to Watsonville.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
In 1899, Spreckels opened an even larger factory
closer to the main sugar beet fields. He named the new factory Spreckels Sugar 
Company. <br/><br/>A company town grew up around the plant, and still exists as Spreckels,
California. The town and the sugar factory were important in the early life of 
novelist John Steinbeck, and several scenes from his novels take place there.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
In the 1890s, Spreckels helped found the national
sugar trust and renamed his San Francisco property the Western Sugar Refinery 
and continued to increase his control over the Hawaiian sugar trade. This 
control over the industry was irksome to Hawaiian planters not directly 
affiliated with Spreckels and his associates.<br/><br/> At the end of the 1890s, they
attempted to break free. In 1905, the planters established a cooperative 
refinery in Crockett, California, the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company 
(C&amp;H). The Spreckels dominance in sugar was broken, but the Western Sugar 
Refinery continued operation in San Francisco until 1951.<br/><br/>

Spreckels was the President of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railway from 1895 until it was sold to the Santa Fe Railway 
in 1901. The railroad built a line that competed with the Southern Pacific 
through the San Joaquin Valley between Richmond and Bakersfield. The railroad 
was welcome competition for shippers who were strangled by Southern Pacific's 
monopoly on shipping rates in the valley. Today this route is
BNSF's main route to Northern California.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
