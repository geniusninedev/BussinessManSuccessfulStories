    In 1945, Muhammed Hashim Premji incorporated Western Indian Vegetable
Products Ltd, based at Amalner, a small town in the Jalgaon district of 
Maharashtra. It used to manufacture cooking oil under the brand name Sunflower 
Vanaspati, and a laundry soap called 787, a byproduct of oil manufacture. In 
1966, on the news of his father's death, the then 21-year-old Azim Premji 
returned home from Stanford University, where he was studying engineering, to 
take charge of Wipro. <br/><br/>The company, which was called Western Indian Vegetable
Products at the time, dealt in hydrogenated oil manufacturing but Azim Premji 
later diversified the company to bakery fats, ethnic ingredient based 
toiletries, hair care soaps, baby toiletries, lighting products, and hydraulic 
cylinders. <br/><br/>In the 1980s, the young entrepreneur, recognising the importance of
the emerging IT field, took advantage of the vacuum left behind by the expulsion 
of IBM from India, changed the company name to Wipro and entered the 
high-technology sector by manufacturing minicomputers under technological 
collaboration with an American company Sentinel Computer Corporation. Thereafter 
Premji made a focused shift from soaps to softw<br />

as Rice King of Burma. After partition, when Jinnah invited his father Muhammed 
Hashem Premji to come to Pakistan, he turned down the request and chose to 
remain in India.<br />
<br />
Premji has a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering degree (equivalent to 
a Bachelor of Engineering degree) from Stanford University, USA. He is married 
to Yasmeen. The couple have two children, Rishad and Tariq. Rishad is currently 
the Chief Strategy Officer of IT Business, Wipro.<br />
<br />
Premji has been recognised by Business Week as one of the Greatest Entrepreneurs 
for being responsible for Wipro emerging as one of the world's fastest growing 
companies.<br />
