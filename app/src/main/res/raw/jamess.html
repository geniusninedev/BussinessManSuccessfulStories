	Washington Duke (1820–1905), had owned a tobacco
company that his sons James Buchanan Duke and Benjamin Newton Duke (1855–1929) 
took over in the 1880s. In 1885, James Buchanan Duke acquired a license to use 
the first automated cigarette making machine (invented by James Albert Bonsack), 
and by 1890, Duke supplied 40% of the American cigarette market (then known as 
pre-rolled tobacco).<br/><br/> In that year, Duke consolidated control of his four major
competitors under one corporate entity, the American Tobacco Company, which was 
a monopoly in the American cigarette market. His robber baron business tactics 
directly led to the Black Patch Tobacco Wars in 1906-1908.<br/><br/>

At the start of the 1900s, Duke tried to conquer the
British market as he had done the American, eventually forcing the then divided 
British manufacturers to merge into the Imperial Tobacco Company of Great 
Britain and Ireland, Ltd (Imperial Tobacco). After two years of intense 
competition in Great Britain, Imperial Tobacco took the fight to the U.S. 
market, forcing American Tobacco to look for a settlement.<br/><br/> This resulted in an
agreement whereby American Tobacco controlled the American trade, Imperial 
Tobacco controlled the trade in the British territories, and a third, 
cooperative venture named the British-American Tobacco Company was set up 
between the two to control the sale of tobacco in the rest of the world. During 
this time, Duke was repeatedly sued by business partners and shareholders. <br/><br/>In
1906, the American Tobacco Company was found guilty of antitrust violations, and 
was ordered to be split into four separate companies: American Tobacco Company, 
Liggett and Myers, R.J. Reynolds, and the P. Lorillard Company.<br/><br/>

In 1892, the Dukes opened their first textile firm in
Durham, North Carolina, that was run by Benjamin Duke. At the turn of the 
century, Buck Duke organized the American Development Company to acquire land 
and water rights on the Catawba River.<br/><br/> In 1904, he established the Catawba Power
Company and the following year he and his brother founded the Southern Power 
Company, which became known as Duke Power, the precursor to the Duke Energy 
conglomerate. The company supplied electrical power to the Duke's textile 
factory and within two decades, their power facilities had been greatly expanded 
and they were supplying electricity to more than 300 cotton mills and other 
industrial companies. <br/><br/>Duke Power established an electrical grid that supplied
cities and towns in the Piedmont Region of North and South Carolina. Lake James, 
a power-generating reservoir in Western North Carolina, was created by the 
company in 1928 and named in Duke's honor. Buck Steam Station in Rowan County, 
North Carolina, built in 1926, is also named for Duke.<br/><br/>

In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an order
breaking up the American Tobacco Company's monopoly. The company was then 
divided into several smaller enterprises, of which only the British-American 
Tobacco Company remained in Duke's control. After his death in 1925, there was a 
great deal of controversy, and some historians suspect that some resentful 
Imperial Tobacco executives were feeling some anger at Duke for having lost the 
Tobacco War between Duke's company and Imperial Tobacco.<br/><br/>

Duke was married twice, first in 1904 to Lillian
Fletcher McCredy. They divorced in 1906 and had no children. In 1907 he married 
the widow Nanaline Holt Inman, with whom he had his only child, a daughter, 
Doris, born November 22, 1912. <br/><br/>Doris was raised at Duke Farms located in
Hillsborough, New Jersey, where her father had worked with landscapers such as 
James Leal Greenleaf (a member of the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted), and 
Horatio Buckenham to transform more than 2,000 acres (8 km2) of farmland and 
woodlots into an extraordinary landscape containing 2 conservatories, 9 lakes, 
35 fountains, 45 buildings, countless pieces of sculpture, over 2 miles (3 km) 
of stone walls and more than 18 miles (29 km) of roadway.Duke died in New York 
City on October 10, 1925, and is interred with his father and brother in the 
Memorial Chapel on the campus of Duke University.<br/><br/> He resided at the James
Buchanan Duke House in Charlotte, North Carolina during the last five years of 
his life. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978</span></p>
