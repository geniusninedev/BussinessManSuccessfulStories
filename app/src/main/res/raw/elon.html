of Maye (née Haldeman), a model and dietician from Regina, Saskatchewan, 
Canada;and Errol Musk, a South African-born electromechanical engineer. He has a 
younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974). 
His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch 
ancestry. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father 
in locations in South Africa.<br />
<br />
At age 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.He 
taught himself computer programming and at age 12, sold the code for a 
BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to a magazine called PC and 
Office Technology for approximately US$500. A web version of the game is 
available online.<br />
<br />
Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood, and was once hospitalized 
when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then beat him until 
he lost consciousness.<br />
<br />
Musk was initially educated at private schools, attending the English-speaking 
Waterkloof House Preparatory School. Musk later graduated from Pretoria Boys 
High School and moved to Canada in June 1989, just before his 18th birthday, 
after obtaining Canadian citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.<br />
<br />
At the age of 19, Musk was accepted into Queen's University in Kingston, 
Ontario, for undergraduate study. In 1992, after spending two years at Queen's 
University, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where, at the 
age of 24, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from its College 
of Arts and Sciences, and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from its 
Wharton School of Business. <br/><br/>Musk extended his studies for one year to finish the
second bachelor's degree. While at the University of Pennsylvania, Musk and 
fellow Penn student Adeo Ressi rented a 10-bedroom fraternity house, using it as 
an unofficial nightclub.<br />
<br />
In 1995, at age 24, Musk moved to California to begin a PhD in applied physics 
and materials science at Stanford University, but left the program after two 
days to pursue his entrepreneurial aspirations in the areas of the Internet, 
renewable energy and outer space. In 2002, he became a U.S. citizen.<br />
<br />
In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, 
with US$28,000 of their father's (Errol Musk) money. The company developed and 
marketed an Internet "city guide" for the newspaper publishing industry. <br/><br/>Musk
obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune and persuaded 
the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch While at 
Zip2, Musk wanted to become CEO; however, none of the board members would allow 
it. Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307 million in cash and US$34 million in stock 
options in February 1999. Musk received 7% or US$22 million from the sale</p>
