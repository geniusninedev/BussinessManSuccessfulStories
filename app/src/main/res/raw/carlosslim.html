Slim always knew he wanted to be a businessman, and he began to develop his 
business and investment acumen at a young age.He received business lessons from 
his father Julian, who taught him finance, management and accounting, teaching 
him how to read<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none;" title="Financial statement">financial

importance of keeping accurate financial records, a practice that Slim carries 
on to this day.</p>

At the age of 11, Carlos invested in a government savings bond that taught him 
about the concept of compound interest. He eventually saved every financial and 
business transaction he made into a personal ledger book which he keeps to this 
day.At the age of 12, he made his first stock purchase, by purchasing shares in 
a Mexican bank.By the age of 15, Slim had become a shareholder in Mexico’s 
largest bank.At the age of 17, he earned 200 pesos a week working for his 
father&#39;s company.He went on to study civil engineering at the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none;" title="National Autonomous University of Mexico">National

Though Slim was a civil engineering major because of his fascination with 
numbers, he also displayed an interest in economics. He took economics courses 
in Chile once he finished his engineering degree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Graduating 
as a civil engineering major, Slim has stated that his mathematical prowess and 
his background of linear
programming was a key factor in
helping him gain an edge in the business world, especially when reading 
financial statements.</p>

Ottoman Empire</a>) in 1902 (he was 14), and later changed his name to Julián 
Slim Haddad.It was not uncommon for Lebanese children to be sent abroad before 
they reached the age of 15 to avoid being conscripted into the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Army_(1861–1922)" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none;" title="Ottoman Army (1861–1922)">Ottoman

Oriente (The Star of the Orient). La Estrella de Oriente was an important dry 
goods store located on Venustiano Carranza where it had merchandise worth more 
than $100,000 by January 21, 1921, only ten years after the business was 
founded.By 1921, he had begun investing in real estate in the flourishing 
commercial district of Mexico City where Julián would acquire prime real estate 
at fire sale prices and in Zocalo District during the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Revolution" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none;" title="Mexican Revolution">1910–17

Julian’s business ventures became the source of considerable wealth for himself
and his family.As a result of financial prosperity of these ventures, Julian 
soon became a prominent and wealthy businessman, where he was able to make 
investments during bad economic cycles due to Mexico&#39;s frequent economic 
downturns.Julián was known for his business savvy, strong work ethic, and 
commitment to traditional Lebanese moral values. Having a deep understanding of 
business that was considered ahead of his time, one of Julián&#39;s many pioneering 
business concepts was an efficient business as one that sold large volumes at 
smaller margins, and with payment facilities, factors that are prevalent in many 
large discount stores today.</p>
