    Sir Terence Hedley Matthews KBE,
FREng,FIEE (born 6 June 1943), is a Welsh-Canadian business magnate, serial 
high-tech entrepreneur, and Wales' first billionaire.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    He has founded or funded
over 100 companies in the high tech communications field, most notably Mitel and 
Newbridge Networks. He is the chairman of Mitel, Wesley Clover, and the Swansea 
Bay City Region board. He owns the Celtic Manor Resort, KRP Properties, the 
Brookstreet Hotel, and the Marshes Golf Club.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Matthews was born in
Newport, South Wales, at the then Lydia Beynon Maternity Hospital. Matthews 
returned as an adult to include the manor house that housed the hospital within 
the Celtic Manor Resort. He grew up in the town of Newbridge, Caerphilly. He 
studied at Swansea University and received a bachelor's degree in electronics in 
1969.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Matthews' first enterprise
was started in collaboration with fellow Briton and Microsystems employee 
Michael Cowpland in 1972. To raise seed money for future enterprises they had 
planned, the pair intended to import and sell electric lawnmowers built in the 
UK. Conventionally and as well accounts by Terry Matthews the name Mitel is 
thought to be a contraction of "Mike and Terry's Lawnmowers". However Cowpland 
is quoted as saying that it stands for "Mike and Terry ELectronics". This first 
endeavour was a fiasco; the shipping company carrying the first batch lost the 
container. When the lawnmowers finally arrived, the ground was covered with snow 
in the Canadian winter and no one would buy them. Matthews later said "That 
taught me a key lesson — the importance of timing. The shipping company lost the 
lawnmowers! By the time they showed up no-one wanted them, as you can't cut 
grass when it's covered with snow."<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Mitel became a technology
consultancy company run from home to the various companies around Ottawa's 
emerging high-tech district. Mitel's clients included the National Research 
Council, the Communications Research Centre, and a handful of pioneering 
start-ups including SHL Systemhouse which was later purchased by EDS and now is 
part of HP and Quasar Systems (now Cognos).<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Obtaining funding from a
$4,000 bank loan and as well from their own savings and a group of angel 
investors (notably Kent Plumley) the two developed a telephony DTMF tone 
receiver based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis. This was a major advance in the 
technology since they were able to sell receivers at a fraction of the cost of 
competing versions, while gaining returns of 1000%. Additionally, Mitel later 
became a chip manufacturer with the acquisition of the Silek foundry in Bromont, 
Quebec.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Later the pair realized that
the then new technology of microprocessors and other semiconductor devices would 
make a similar change in the market for small PBXs. The SX200 PBX launched to 
immense success, being cheaper to purchase, quicker to install and far more 
functional. Mitel became one of the more successful manufacturers of small PBX 
systems and telecom semiconductors in the world, floating on the New York Stock 
Exchange in 1981.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    In 1985, British Telecom
bought a controlling interest in Mitel. Cowpland would later form the company 
that became Corel and Matthews later founded Newbridge Networks.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    In 1986, Matthews drove
Newbridge to become a leader in the worldwide data networking industry, 
manufacturing data communications products, especially ATM devices and routers. 
In 2000 the company employed more than 6,500 employees with recorded FY 1999 
revenue of $1.8 billion. Later in 2000, Newbridge was acquired by Alcatel for 
$7.1 billion. Matthews' personal stake in Newbridge was valued at over a billion 
dollars, and as a result of the transaction he became the largest single 
shareholder in Alcatel.</span></span></p>
