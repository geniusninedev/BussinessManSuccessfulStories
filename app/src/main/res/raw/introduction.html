<b>Entrepreneurship</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>has 
traditionally been defined as the process of designing, launching and running a 
new<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;business</span>, which typically begins 
as a<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;small business</span>, such as a<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;startup 
company</span>, offering a product, process or service for sale or hire, and the 
people who do so are called 'entrepreneurs'.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>It 
has been defined as the "...capacity and willingness to develop, organize, and 
manage a business venture along with any of its risks in order to make a<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;profit</span>"<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>While 
definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of 
businesses, due to the high<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none;" title="Risk">risks</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>involved 
in launching a start-up, a significant proportion of businesses have to close, 
due to a "...lack of funding, bad business decisions, an economic crisis -- or a 
combination of all of these"or due to lack of market demand. In the 2000s, the 
definition of "entrepreneurship" has been expanded to explain how and why some 
individuals (or teams) identify opportunities, evaluate them as viable, and then 
decide to exploit them, whereas others do not,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>and, 
in turn, how entrepreneurs use these opportunities to develop new products or 
services, launch new firms or even new industries and create wealth.</p>

Traditionally, an<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><b>entrepreneur</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>has 
been defined as "a person who organizes and manages any enterprise, especially a 
business, usually with considerable initiative and<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>risk".Rather 
than working as an<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>employee, an 
entrepreneur runs a<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;small business&nbsp;</span>and 
assumes all the risk and reward of a given business venture, idea, or good or 
service offered for sale. The entrepreneur is commonly seen as a business leader 
and<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;innovator&nbsp;</span>of new ideas and 
business processes."<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Entrepreneurs 
tend to be good at perceiving new business opportunities and they often exhibit 
positive<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;biases&nbsp;</span>in their perception 
(i.e., a bias towards finding new possibilities and seeing unmet market needs) 
and a pro-risk-taking attitude that makes them more likely to exploit the 
opportunity.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: inherit; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
An entrepreneur is typically in control of a commercial undertaking, directing 
the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>factors of production–the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;human&nbsp;</span>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">financial&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and 
material resources–that are required to exploit a business opportunity. They act 
as the manager and oversee the launch and growth of an enterprise. 
Entrepreneurship is the process by which an individual (or team) identifies a 
business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required 
for its exploitation. The exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may 
include actions such as developing a<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;business 
plan</span>, hiring the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;human resources</span>, 
acquiring financial and material resources, providing<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;leadership</span>, 
and being responsible for the venture's success or failure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Economist<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;joseph 
schempeter&nbsp;</span>(1883–1950) stated that the role of the entrepreneur in the 
economy is "creative destuction"–launching innovations that simultaneously 
destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches. For 
Schumpeter, the changes and "dynamic<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;disequilibrium&nbsp;</span>brought 
on by the innovating entrepreneur . the ‘norm’ of a healthy<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;economy</span>."</p>

"Entrepreneurial spirit is characterized by innovation and risk-taking."<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>While 
entrepreneurship is often associated with new, small, for-profit start-ups, 
entrepreneurial behavior can be seen in small-, medium- and large-sized firms, 
new and established firms and in for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, 
including voluntary sector groups,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;charitable 
organisations&nbsp;</span>and<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;government</span>.For 
example, in the 2000s, the field of<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;social 
enterpreneurship&nbsp;</span>has been identified, in which entrepreneurs combine 
business activities with humanitarian, environmental or community goals.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: inherit; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Entrepreneurship typically operates within an<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;enterpreneurship&nbsp;economy&nbsp;</span>which 
often includes government programs and services that promote entrepreneurship 
and support entrepreneurs and start-ups; non-governmental organizations such as 
small business associations and organizations that offer advice and mentoring to 
entrepreneurs (e.g., through entrepreneurship centers or websites); small 
business<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;advocacy organisations&nbsp;</span>that 
lobby the government for increased support for entrepreneurship programs and 
more small business-friendly laws and regulations; entrepreneurship resources 
and facilities (e.g.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;business incubators&nbsp;</span>and<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;seed 
accelerators</span>); entrepreneurship education and training programs offered 
by schools, colleges and universities; and financing (e.g., bank loans,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;venture 
capital financing</span>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;angel investing</span>, 
and government and private foundation grants). The strongest entrepreneurship 
ecosystems are those found in top entrepreneurship hubs such as<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;silicon 
valley</span>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;new york city</span>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;bBoston</span>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;singapore&nbsp;</span>and 
other such locations where there are<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;clusters&nbsp;</span>of 
leading high-tech firms, top<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;research 
universitues</span>, and venture capitalists.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>In 
the 2010s, entrepreneurship can be studied in college or university as part of 
the disciplines of<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;management&nbsp;</span>or<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;business 
administration</span>.</p>
