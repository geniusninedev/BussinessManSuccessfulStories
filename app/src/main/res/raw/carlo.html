    Slim was born on January 28, 1940, in Mexico City, to Julián Slim Haddad
(born Khalil Salim Haddad Aglamaz) and Linda Helú Atta, both Maronite Catholics 
of Lebanese descent.<br />
<br />
Slim always knew he wanted to be a businessman, and he began to develop his 
business and investment acumen at a young age. He received business lessons from 
his father Julian, who taught him finance, management and accounting, teaching 
him how to read financial statements as well as the importance of keeping 
accurate financial records, a practice that Slim carries on to this day.<br />
<br />
At the age of 11, Carlos invested in a government savings bond that taught him 
about the concept of compound interest. He eventually saved every financial and 
business transaction he made into a personal ledger book which he keeps to this 
day.[18] At the age of 12, he made his first stock purchase, by purchasing 
shares in a Mexican bank. By the age of 15, Slim had become a shareholder in 
Mexico’s largest bank.At the age of 17, he earned 200 pesos a week working for 
his father's company. He went on to study civil engineering at the National 
Autonomous University of Mexico, where he also concurrently taught algebra and 
linear programming.<br />
<br />
Though Slim was a civil engineering major because of his fascination with 
numbers, he also displayed an interest in economics. He took economics courses 
in Chile once he finished his engineering degree. Graduating as a civil t
engineering major, Slim has stated that his mathematical prowess and his 
background of linear programming was a key factor in helping him gain an edge in 
the business world, especially when reading financial statements.<br /><br />
In 2013 Slim's company, Grupo Carso opened Mexico City's Telcel Theater, which 
operates in conjunction with his entertainment company, Grupo CIE (Corporación 
Interamericana de Entretenimiento), Mexico's equivalent of Live Nation.<br />
<br />
In April 2013 Slim entered the business of managing Mexican prisons to expand 
the investments of his construction-financing company. Ideal acquired stakes in 
two federal prisons from Desarrolladora Homex SAB, a Mexican homebuilder where 
Slim's companies will receive 4 billion pesos (US$326 million) within the 
agreement. The company ran his son, Marco Antonio Slim would add the prisons to 
its portfolio of infrastructure assets among which include toll roads, 
hydroelectric dams, and water-treatment plants.<br />
<br />
In July 2013 Slim's company America Movill invested US$40 million in Shazam, a 
British commercial mobile phone-based music identification service for an 
undisclosed share. America Movil partnered with the company to aid its growth 
into advertising and television and help the audio recognition service expand in 
Latin America.<br />
<br />
In November 2013 Slim invested US$60 million in the Israeli startup Mobli, a 
company that deals with connections between people and communities corralled 
according to different interests.<br />
<br />
In December 2013 Slim's private equity fund, Sinca Inbursa, sold its stake in 
Mexican pharmaceutical company Landsteiner Scientific. Slim acquired a 27.51 
stake in the company in June 2008 and represented 6.6 percent of Sinca's 
investment portfolio. The private equity fund's investments are mainly in 
transportation and infrastructure and the fund had total market cap of 5.152 
billion pesos at the end of 2012.<br />
<br />
Slim has also set his sights within the energy industry as well. In 2011, Slim 
began buying a 70 percent stake in Geoprocesados SA's Tabasco Oil Co., gaining 
access to the Colombian oil market as the country seeks to boost crude and 
natural-gas output. Slim began seeking to boost his oil investments in Colombia 
because of the country’s open policies on exploration as well as furthering its 
commitment to double output by 2020.<br/><br/>Investors have also been drawn to Colombia
because of improved security as well as a clear government regulatory framework 
for oil drilling. In 2013, Mexico's national oil and gas company Pemex hired an 
offshore drilling rig from the Carso Group. Under the agreement, Pemex will 
operate the rig on a seven-year contract and will pay US$415 million. The rig is 
owned by Operadora Cicsa, a subsidiary of Carso Group.<br/><br/>The relationship between
Pemex and Slim rans back as early as in 2006, where NOC hired CICSA for the 
drilling and completion of over 60 wells in the southern region‍—‌covering the 
Cinco Presidentes, Macuspana-Muspac, Samaria-Luna and Bellota-Jujo assets – and 
for the expansion of a petrochemical plant in Veracruz.<br/><br/> Carso's infrastructure
and construction subsidiary has been awarded with several oil well development 
contracts in Pemex's main assets‍—‌including Chicontepec‍—‌as well as tenders 
for the construction of natural gas pipelines and marine platforms. With the 
2008 Pemex Law reform, the creation of integrated service contracts and the 
perspectives for a future energy reform, Slim has begun seizing business and 
investment opportunities in Mexico's oil and gas industry. <br/><br/>CICSA's pipe
manufacturing division Swepomex into a marine platform provider. CICSA has also 
acquired majority shares in Oklahoma contractor Bronco Drilling, along with 
minority participations in Houston drilling company Allis Chalmers Energy. Slim 
controls a 15 percent stake in Bronco, with warrants that could boost the stake 
to 20 percent. <br/><br/>He also has a 2.9 percent stake in Allis-Chalmers. 15% of the
country’s main gas operator, Gas Natural Mexico now belong to Sinca Inbursa, a 
private equity fund controlled by Slim. Slim Helú has also maintained an 
important business presence in Spanish oil company Repsol and its Argentinian 
subsidiary YPF, Argentina's largest oil company, where Slim has an 8.4 percent 
stake.<br />
<br />
On April 23, 2014, Slim took control of Telekom Austria, Austria's biggest phone 
carrier, which has telcos in countries such as Bulgaria, Croatia and Belarus, 
under a 10-year agreement, was Slim's first successful business acquisition in 
Europe. <br/><br/>In a syndicate holding structure the Austrian state holding company
OIAG's 28 percent are combined with Slim's 27 percent ownership. America Movil 
will spend as much as US$2 billion to buy out minority shareholders in a 
mandatory public offer and invest up to 1 billion euros (US$1.38 billion) into 
the company, which it sees as "platform for expansion into central and eastern 
Europe". Labor representatives boycotted attending the OIAG supervisory board 
meeting for 12 hours criticizing lack of explicit job guarantees.<br />
<br />
In July 2014 Slim invested in WellAware, a Texas-based oil and gas software 
developer, this investment was also made with former Republican vice president 
Dick Cheney. External funding was provided by Activant Capital Group and Slim, 
along with participation from strategic investors and WellAware board members Ed 
Whitacre.<br/><br/> When Mexico eventually prepared to open its oil and gas sectors to
domestic and foreign private capital for the first time in 75 years, it has been 
widely speculated that Slim will play a major role toward contributing to 
Mexico's new energy landscape. <br/><br/>Slim's investment in WellAware, whose software
allows oil and gas companies to track wells and pipelines remotely and collates 
data for making forecasts, adds to a number of oil-related investments that he 
has been making in the past years in Mexico, Latin America and the United States</p>
