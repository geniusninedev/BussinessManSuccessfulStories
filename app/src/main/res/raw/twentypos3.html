was Jeanne's second child with Albert Chanel; the first, Julia, was born less 
than a year earlier.Albert Chanel was an itinerant street vendor who peddled 
work clothes and undergarments,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>living 
a nomadic life, traveling to and from market towns. The family resided in 
rundown lodgings. In 1884, he married Jeanne Devolle,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>persuaded 
to do so by her family who had "united, effectively, to pay Albert to marry 
her."<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>At birth, Chanel's name was 
entered into the official registry as "Chasnel". Jeanne was too unwell to attend 
the registration, and Albert was registered as "travelling".With both parents 
absent, the infant's last name was misspelled, probably due to a clerical error. 
The couple had five children who survived—two boys and three girls—who lived 
crowded into a one-room lodging in the town of<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><a class="auto-style1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brive-la-Gaillarde" style="text-decoration: none; background: none;" title="Brive-la-Gaillarde">Brive-la-Gaillarde</a><span class="auto-style1">.</span></p>

<span class="auto-style1">When Gabrielle was 12,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>her 
mother died of bronchitis at the age of 32.Her father sent his two sons out to 
work as farm laborers and sent his three daughters to the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><a class="auto-style1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrèze" style="text-decoration: none; background: none;" title="Corrèze">Corrèze</a><span class="auto-style1">,

which ran an orphanage. Its religious order, the Congregation of the Sacred 
Heart of Mary, was "founded to care for the poor and rejected, including running 
homes for abandoned and orphaned girls".<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>It 
was a stark, frugal life, demanding strict discipline. At age eighteen, Chanel, 
too old to remain at Aubazine, went to live in a boarding house set aside for 
Catholic girls in the town of<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><a class="auto-style1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulins,_Allier" style="text-decoration: none; background: none;" title="Moulins, Allier">Moulins</a><span class="auto-style1">.</span></p>

Later in her life, Chanel would retell the story of her childhood somewhat 
differently; she would often include more glamorous accounts, which were 
generally untrue.She said that when her mother died, her father sailed for 
America to seek his fortune, and she was sent to live with two aunts. She also 
claimed to have been born a decade later than 1883 and that her mother had died 
when she was much younger than 12.</p>

Chanel was able to find employment as a seamstress.When not plying her needle, 
she sang in a cabaret frequented by cavalry officers. Chanel made her stage

the performers who entertained the crowd between star turns. The money earned 
was what they managed to accumulate when the plate was passed among the audience 
in appreciation of their performance. It was at this time that Gabrielle 
acquired the name "Coco", possibly based on two popular songs with which she 
became identified, "Ko Ko Ri Ko", and "Qui qu'a vu Coco", or it was an allusion 
to the French word for<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><a class="auto-style1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kept_woman" style="text-decoration: none; background: none;" title="Kept woman">kept

Vichy boasted a profusion of concert halls, theatres and cafes where she hoped 
to achieve success as a performer. Chanel's youth and physical charms impressed 
those for whom she auditioned, but her singing voice was marginal and she failed 
to find stage work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Obliged to find 
employment, she took work at the "Grande Grille", where as a<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i>donneuse 
d'eau</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>she was one of the females 
whose job was to dispense glasses of the purportedly curative mineral water for 
which Vichy was renowned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>When the 
Vichy season ended, Chanel returned to Moulins, and her former haunt "La 
Rotonde". She now realised that a serious stage career was not in her future</span></p>
