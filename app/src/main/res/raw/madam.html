	Breedlove was born on December 23, 1867, near
Delta, Louisiana, to Owen and Minerva (Anderson) Breedlove.Sarah was one of six 
children, which included an older sister, Louvenia, and four brothers: 
Alexander, James, Solomon, and Owen Jr. Breedlove's parents and her older 
siblings were enslaved on Robert W. Burney's Madison Parish plantation, but 
Sarah was the first child in her family born into freedom after the Emancipation 
Proclamation was signed. Her mother died, possibly from cholera, in 1872; her 
father remarried, but he died within a few years.<br/><br/> Orphaned at
the age of seven, Sarah moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, at the age of ten and 
worked as a domestic. Prior to her first marriage, she lived with her older 
sister, Louvenia, and brother-in-law, Jesse Powell.<br/><br/>In 1882, at the age of fourteen, Sarah married Moses
McWilliams, possibly to escape mistreatment from her brother-in-law. Sarah and 
Moses had one daughter, Lelia McWilliams, born on June 6, 1885. When Moses died 
in 1887, Sarah was twenty; Lelia was two years old.Sarah remarried in 1894, but 
left her second husband, John Davis, around 1903 and moved to Denver, Colorado, 
in 1905.<br/><br/>

In January 1906, Sarah married Charles Joseph Walker,
a newspaper advertising salesman she had known in Missouri. Through this 
marriage, she became known as Madam C. J. Walker. The couple divorced in 1912; 
Charles died in 1926. Lelia McWilliams adopted her stepfather's surname and 
became known as A'Lelia Walker.<br/><br/>

vIn 1888 Sarah and her daughter moved to Saint Louis,
Missouri, where three of her brothers lived. Sarah found work as a laundress, 
barely earning more than a dollar a day, but she was determined to make enough 
money to provide her daughter with a formal education.During the 1880s, 
Breedlove lived in a community where ragtime music was developed—she sang at the 
St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church and started to yearn for an educated 
life as she watched the community of women at her church.<br/><br/> As was common among
black women of her era, Sarah experienced severe dandruff and other scalp 
ailments, including baldness, due to skin disorders and the application of harsh 
products such as lye that were included in soaps to cleanse hair and wash 
clothes. Other contributing factors to her hair loss included poor diet, 
illnesses, and infrequent bathing and hair washing during a time when most 
Americans lacked indoor plumbing, central heating and electricity.<br/><br/>

Initially, Sarah learned about hair care from her
brothers, who were barbers in Saint Louis. Around the time of the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition (World Fair at St. Louis in 1904), she became a commission 
agent selling products for Annie Turnbo Malone, an African American hair-care 
entrepreneur and owner of the Poro Company.While working for Malone, who would 
later become Walker’s largest rival in the hair-care industry. Sarah began to 
adapt her knowledge of hair and hair products to develop her own product line.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
In July 1905, when she was thirty-seven years old,
Sarah and her daughter moved to Denver, Colorado, where she continued to sell 
products for Malone and develop her own hair-care business. Following her 
marriage to Charles Walker in 1906, she became known as Madam C. J. Walker and 
marketed herself as an independent hairdresser and retailer of cosmetic creams. <br/><br/>
(“Madam” was adopted from women pioneers of the French beauty industry.) Her 
husband, who was also her business partner, provided advice on advertising and 
promotion; Sarah sold her products door to door, teaching other black women how 
to groom and style their hair.<br/><br/>

In 1906 Walker put her daughter in charge of the mail
order operation in Denver while she and her husband traveled throughout the 
southern and eastern United States to expand the business.In 1908 Walker and her 
husband relocated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where they opened a beauty parlor 
and established Lelia College to train "hair culturists." After closing the 
business in Denver in 1907, A'lelia ran the day-to-day operations from 
Pittsburgh, while Walker established a new base in Indianapolis in 1910. A'lelia 
also persuaded her mother to establish an office and beauty salon in New York 
City's Harlem neighborhood in 1913</span><br class="auto-style1" />

In 1910 Walker relocated her business to Indianapolis,
where she established the headquarters for the Madame C. J. Walker Manufacturing 
Company. She initially purchased a house and factory at 640 North West Street. 
Walker later built a factory, hair salon, and beauty school to train her sales 
agents, and added a laboratory to help with research. <br/><br/>She also assembled a
competent staff that included Freeman Ransom, Robert Lee Brokenburr, Alice 
Kelly, and Marjorie Stewart Joyner, among others, to assist in managing the 
growing company. Many of her company's employees, including those in key 
management and staff positions, were women.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
To increase her company's sales force, Walker trained
other women to become "beauty culturists" using "The Walker System", her method 
of grooming that was designed to promote hair growth and to condition the scalp 
through the use of her products. <br/><br/>Walker's system included a shampoo, a pomade
stated to help hair grow, strenuous brushing, and applying iron combs to hair. 
This method claimed to make lackluster and brittle hair become soft and 
luxurious Walker's product line had several competitors.<br/><br/> Similar products were
produced in Europe and manufactured by other companies in the United States, 
which included her major rivals, Annie Turnbo Malone's Poro System and later, 
Sarah Spencer Washington's Apex System</span></p>
