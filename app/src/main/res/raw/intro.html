launching and running a new business, which typically begins as a small 
business, such as a startup company, offering a product, process or service for 
sale or hire, and the people who do so are called 'entrepreneurs'.<br/><br/> It has been
defined as the "...capacity and willingness to develop, organize, and manage a 
business venture along with any of its risks in order to make a profit." While 
definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of 
businesses, due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up, a 
significant proportion of businesses have to close, due to a "...lack of 
funding, bad business decisions, an economic crisis -- or a combination of all 
of these" or due to lack of market demand.<br/><br/> In the 2000s, the definition of
"entrepreneurship" has been expanded to explain how and why some individuals (or 
teams) identify opportunities, evaluate them as viable, and then decide to 
exploit them, whereas others do not,and, in turn, how entrepreneurs use these 
opportunities to develop new products or services, launch new firms or even new 
industries and create wealth.<br />
<br />
Traditionally, an entrepreneur has been defined as "a person who organizes and 
manages any enterprise, especially a business, usually with considerable 
initiative and risk". "Rather than working as an employee, an entrepreneur runs 
a small business and assumes all the risk and reward of a given business 
venture, idea, or good or service offered for sale. <br/><br/>The entrepreneur is commonly
seen as a business leader and innovator of new ideas and business processes." 
Entrepreneurs tend to be good at perceiving new business opportunities and they 
often exhibit positive biases in their perception (i.e., a bias towards finding 
new possibilities and seeing unmet market needs) and a pro-risk-taking attitude 
that makes them more likely to exploit the opportunity.<br />
<br />
An entrepreneur is typically in control of a commercial undertaking, directing 
the factors of production–the human, financial and material resources–that are 
required to exploit a business opportunity.<br/><br/> They act as the manager and oversee
the launch and growth of an enterprise. Entrepreneurship is the process by which 
an individual (or team) identifies a business opportunity and acquires and 
deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation.<br/><br/> The exploitation
of entrepreneurial opportunities may include actions such as developing a 
business plan, hiring the human resources, acquiring financial and material 
resources, providing leadership, and being responsible for the venture's success 
or failure. Economist Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950) stated that the role of the 
entrepreneur in the economy is "creative destruction"–launching innovations that 
simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and 
approaches. For Schumpeter, the changes and "dynamic disequilibrium brought on 
by the innovating entrepreneur the ‘norm’ of a healthy economy."<br />
<br />
"Entrepreneurial spirit is characterized by innovation and risk-taking."While 
entrepreneurship is often associated with new, small, for-profit start-ups, 
entrepreneurial behavior can be seen in small-, medium- and large-sized firms, 
new and established firms and in for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, 
including voluntary sector groups, charitable organizations and government.<br/><br/> For
example, in the 2000s, the field of social entrepreneurship has been identified, 
in which entrepreneurs combine business activities with humanitarian, 
environmental or community goals.<br />
<br />
Entrepreneurship typically operates within an entrepreneurship ecosystem which 
often includes government programs and services that promote entrepreneurship 
and support entrepreneurs and start-ups; non-governmental organizations such as 
small business associations and organizations that offer advice and mentoring to 
entrepreneurs (e.g., through entrepreneurship centers or websites); small 
business advocacy organizations that lobby the government for increased support 
for entrepreneurship programs and more small business-friendly laws and 
regulations; entrepreneurship resources and facilities (e.g., business 
incubators and seed accelerators); entrepreneurship education and training 
programs offered by schools, colleges and universities; and financing (e.g., 
bank loans, venture capital financing, angel investing, and government and 
private foundation grants). The strongest entrepreneurship ecosystems are those 
found in top entrepreneurship hubs such as Silicon Valley, New York City, 
Boston, Singapore and other such locations where there are clusters of leading 
high-tech firms, top research universities, and venture capitalists. In the 
2010s, entrepreneurship can be studied in college or university as part of the 
disciplines of management or business administration.<br/><br/>
Stanford University economist Edward Lazear found in a 2005 study that
variety in education and work experience was the most important trait that 
distinguished entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs A 2013 study by Uschi 
Backes-Gellner of the University of Zurich and Petra Moog of the University of 
Siegen in Germany found that a diverse social network was also important in 
distinguishing students who would go on to become entrepreneurs<br />
<br />
Studies show that the psychological propensities for male and female 
entrepreneurs are more similar than different. Empirical studies suggest that 
female entrepreneurs possess strong negotiating skills and consensus-forming 
abilities. Asa Hansson, who looked at empirical evidence from Sweden, found that 
the probability of becoming self-employed decreases with age for women, but 
increases with age for men.She also found that marriage increased the 
probability of a person becoming an entrepreneur.<br />
<br />
Jesper Sørensen wrote that significant influences on the decision to become an 
entrepreneur are workplace peers and social composition. Sørensen discovered a 
correlation between working with former entrepreneurs and how often these 
individuals become entrepreneurs themselves, compared to those who did not work 
with entrepreneurs. Social composition can influence entrepreneurialism in peers 
by demonstrating the possibility for success, stimulating a "He can do it, why 
can't I?" attitude. As Sørensen stated, "When you meet others who have gone out 
on their own, it doesn't seem that crazy."<br />
<br />
Entrepreneurs may also be driven to entrepreneurship by past experiences. If 
they have faced multiple work stoppages or have been unemployed in the past the 
probability of them becoming an entrepreneur increases Per Cattell's personality 
framework, both personality traits and attitudes are thoroughly investigated by 
psychologists. However, in case of entrepreneurship research, these notions are 
employed by academics too, but vaguely.<br/><br/> According to Cattell, personality is a
system that is related to the environment. He further adds that the system seeks 
explanation to the complex transactions conducted by both - traits and 
attitudes. This is because both of them bring about change and growth in a 
person. Personality is that which informs what an individual will do when faced 
with a given situation. A person's response is triggered by his/her personality 
and the situation that is faced.<br />
<br />
Innovative entrepreneurs may be more likely to experience what psychologist 
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls flow. "Flow" occurs when an individual forgets 
about the outside world due to being thoroughly engaged in a process or 
activity. Csikszentmihalyi suggested that breakthrough innovations tend to occur 
at the hands of individuals in that state.Other research has concluded that a 
strong internal motivation is a vital ingredient for breakthrough 
innovation.<br/><br/>Flow can be compared to Maria Montessori's concept of normalization,
a state that includes a child's capacity for joyful and lengthy periods of 
intense concentration. Csikszentmihalyi acknowledged that Montessori's prepared 
environment offers children opportunities to achieve flow. Thus quality and type 
of early education may influence entrepreneurial capability.<br />
<br />
Research on high risk settings such as oil platforms, investment banking, 
medical surgery, aircraft piloting and nuclear powerplants has related distrust 
to failure avoidance. When non-routine strategies are needed, distrusting 
persons perform better, while when routine strategies are needed trusting 
persons perform better.<br/><br/> This research was extended to entrepreneurial firms by
Gudmundsson and Lechner. They argued that in entrepreneurial firms the threat of 
failure is ever present resembling non-routine situations in high risk settings. 
They found that the firms of distrusting entrepreneurs were more likely to 
survive than the firms of optimistic or overconfident entrepreneurs.<br/><br/> The reasons
were that distrusting entrepreneurs would emphasize failure avoidance through 
sensible task selection, and more analysis.<br/><br/> Kets de Vries has pointed out that
distrusting entrepreneurs are more alert about their external environment. He 
concluded that distrusting entrepreneurs are less likely to discount negative 
events, and are more likely to engage control mechanisms. Similarly Gudmundsson 
and Lechner found that distrust leads to higher precaution and therefore 
increases chances of entrepreneurial firm survival.</p>
