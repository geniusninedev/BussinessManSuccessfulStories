	Dhirajlal Hirachand&nbsp;"Dhirubhai"&nbsp;Ambani&nbsp;(28 December
1932 – 6 July 2002) was an Indian&nbsp;business tycoon&nbsp;who founded&nbsp;Reliance 
Industries&nbsp;in&nbsp;Bombay&nbsp;with his cousin. He had been figured in the&nbsp;The Sunday 
Timestop 50 businessmen in Asia.&nbsp;Ambani took Reliance Industries public in 1977 
and by 2007, the combined fortune of the family was $60 billion, making the 
Ambanis the third richest family in the world.&nbsp;Ambani died on 6
July 2002.&nbsp;In 2016, He was honored posthumously with the&nbsp;Padma Vibhushan, 
India's second highest civilian honor for his contributions towards the field of 
Trade and Industry<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">He founded&nbsp;Reliance Industries&nbsp;in 1966, and as of
2012, the company has over 85,000 employees and provides almost 5% of 
the&nbsp;Central Government's total tax revenue. As of 2012, Reliance Industries was 
listed among top 10&nbsp;Fortune 500&nbsp;list of world's biggest companies by revenues.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Dhirubhai Ambani returned from Yemen to India and
started "Majin" in partnership with Champaklal Damani, his second cousin, who 
lived with him in Turkey . Majin was to import polyester yarn and export spices 
to Yemen. The first office of the Reliance Commercial Corporation was set up at 
the Narsinatha Street in Masjid Bunder. <br/><br/>It was a 350 sq ft (33 m2) room with a
telephone, one table and three chairs. Initially, they had two assistants to 
help them with their business. During this period, Ambani and his family stayed 
in a two-bedroom apartment at the Jai Hind Estate in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai. In 
1965, Champaklal Damani and Dhirubhai Ambani ended their partnership and Ambani 
started on his own.<br/><br/> It is believed that both had different temperaments and a
different take on how to conduct business. While Damani was a cautious trader 
and did not believe in building yarn inventories, Ambani was a known risk-taker 
and believed in building inventories to increase profit.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Extensive marketing of the brand in the interiors of
India made it a household name. Franchise retail outlets were started and they 
used to sell "only Vimal" brand of textiles. In the year 1975, a Technical team 
from the World Bank visited the Reliance Textiles' Manufacturing unit.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
In 1982, Reliance Industries came up against a rights
issue regarding partly convertible debentures. It was rumored that the company 
was making all efforts to ensure that their stock prices did not slide an inch. 
Sensing an opportunity, The Bear Cartel, a group of stock brokers from Calcutta, 
started to short sell the shares of Reliance.<br/><br/> To counter this, a group of stock
brokers until recently referred to as "Friends of Reliance" started to buy the 
short sold shares of Reliance Industries on the Bombay Stock Exchange.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
The Bear Cartel was acting on the belief that the
Bulls would be short of cash to complete the transactions and would be ready for 
settlement under the "Badla" trading system operative in the Bombay Stock 
Exchange. The bulls kept buying and a price of 152 per share was maintained 
until the day of settlement. <br/><br/>On the day of settlement, the Bear Cartel was taken
aback when the Bulls demanded a physical delivery of shares. To complete the 
transaction, the much money was provided to the stock brokers who had bought 
shares of Reliance, by Dhirubhai Ambani. In the case of non-settlement, the 
Bulls demanded an Unbadla, or penalty sum, of 35 per share. With this, the 
demand increased and the shares of Reliance shot above ₹ 180 in minutes. The 
settlement caused an enormous uproar in the market<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
To find a solution to this situation, the Bombay Stock
Exchange was closed for three business days. Authorities from the Bombay Stock 
Exchange (BSE) intervened in the matter and brought down the "Unbadla" rate to ₹ 
2 with a stipulation that the Bear Cartel had to deliver the shares within the 
next few days. The Bear Cartel bought shares of Reliance from the market at 
higher price levels and it was also learnt that Dhirubhai Ambani himself 
supplied those shares to the Bear Cartel and earned a healthy profit out of The 
Bear Cartel's adventure.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
After this incident, many questions were raised by his
detractors and the press. Not many people were able to understand as to how a 
yarn trader until a few years ago was able to get in such a huge amount of cash 
flow during a crisis period. The answer to this was provided by the then finance 
minister, Pranab Mukherjee in the Parliament.<br/><br/> He informed the house that a
Non-Resident Indian had invested up to 220 million in Reliance during 1982–83. 
These investments were routed through many companies like Crocodile, Lota and 
Fiasco. These companies were primarily registered in Isle of Man. The 
interesting factor was that all the promoters or owners of these companies had a 
common surname Shah. <br/><br/>An investigation by the Reserve Bank of India in the
incident did not find any unethical or illegal acts or transactions committed by 
Reliance or its promoters</span></p>
