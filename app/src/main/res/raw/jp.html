The New York Chemical Manufacturing Company was founded in 1823 as a maker of 
various chemicals. In 1824, the company amended its charter to perform banking 
activities and created the Chemical Bank of New York. <br/><br/>After 1851, the bank was
separated from its parent and grew organically and through a series of mergers, 
most notably with Corn Exchange Bank in 1954, Texas Commerce Bank (a large bank 
in Texas) in 1986, and Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company in 1991 (the first 
major bank merger "among equals").<br/><br/> In the 1980s and early 1990s, Chemical
emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of leveraged buyout transactions. 
In 1984, Chemical launched Chemical Venture Partners to invest in private equity 
transactions alongside various financial sponsors. <br/><br/>By the late 1980s, Chemical
developed its reputation for financing buyouts, building a syndicated leveraged 
finance business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of 
pioneering investment banker, Jimmy Lee.<br/><br/>At many points throughout this history,
Chemical Bank was the largest bank in the United States (either in terms of 
assets or deposit market share).<br />
<br />
In 1996, Chemical Bank acquired Chase Manhattan. Although Chemical was the 
nominal survivor, it took the better-known Chase name. To this day, JPMorgan 
Chase retains Chemical's pre-1996 stock price history, as well as Chemical's 
former headquarters at 270 Park Avenue.</p>
