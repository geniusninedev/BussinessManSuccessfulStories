	Johns Hopkins was born on May 19, 1795. He was one
of eleven children born to Samuel Hopkins (1759–1814) of Crofton, Maryland, and 
Hannah Janney (1774–1864), of Loudoun County, Virginia. His home was Whitehall, 
a 500-acre (two km²) tobacco plantation in Anne Arundel County. His first name 
was inherited from his grandfather Johns Hopkins who received his first name 
when his mother Margaret Johns married Gerard Hopkins.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
The Hopkins family were members of the Society of
Friends (Quakers). In 1807 they emancipated their slaves in accordance with 
their local Society decree, which called for freeing the able-bodied and caring 
for the others, who would remain at the plantation and provide labor as they 
could. The second eldest of eleven children, 12-year-old Johns was required to 
work on the farm, interrupting his formal education. From 1806 to 1809, he 
likely attended The Free School of Anne Arundel County, which was located in 
today's Davidsonville, Maryland.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
In 1812, at the age of 17, Hopkins left the plantation
to work in his uncle Gerard Hopkins' Baltimore wholesale grocery business. While 
living with his uncle's family, Johns and his cousin, Elizabeth, fell in love; 
however, the Quaker taboo against marriage of first cousins was especially 
strong, and neither Johns nor Elizabeth ever married.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
As he became able, Hopkins provided for his extended
family, both during his life and posthumously through his will. He bequeathed a 
home for Elizabeth, where she lived until her death in 1889.<br/><br/>

Whitehall Plantation is located in today's Crofton,
Maryland. Its home, since restored and modified, is on Johns Hopkins Road, 
adjacent to Riedel Road. The heavily landscaped property is surrounded by Walden 
Golf Course, and bears a historic marker.<br/><br/>

Hopkins' early experiences and successes in business
came when he was put in charge of the store while his uncle was away during the 
War of 1812. After seven years with his uncle, Hopkins went into business 
together with Benjamin Moore, a fellow Quaker. The business partnership was 
later dissolved with Moore purporting Hopkins' penchant for capital accumulation 
as the cause for the divide.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
After Moore's withdrawal, Hopkins partnered with three
of his brothers and Hopkins &amp; Brothers Wholesalers in 1819. The company 
prospered by selling various wares in the Shenandoah Valley from Conestoga 
wagons, sometimes in exchange for corn whiskey, which was then sold in Baltimore 
as "Hopkins' Best". The bulk of Hopkins' fortune however was made by his 
judicious investments in myriad ventures, most notably the Baltimore and Ohio 
Railroad (B&amp;O), of which he became a director in 1847 and chairman of the 
Finance Committee in 1855. He was also President of Merchants' Bank as well as 
director of a number of other organizations. After a successful career, Hopkins 
was able to retire at the age of 52 in 1847.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
A charitable individual, Hopkins put up his own money
more than once to not only aid Baltimore City during times of financial crises, 
but also to twice bail the railroad out of debt, in 1857 and 1873. In 1996, 
Johns Hopkins ranked 69th in "The Wealthy 100: From Benjamin Franklin to Bill 
Gates - A Ranking of the Richest Americans, Past and Present.<br/><br/><strong>Civil War:</strong></span><br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
One of the first campaigns of the American Civil War
was planned at Johns Hopkins' summer estate, Clifton, where he had also 
entertained a number of foreign dignitaries including the future King Edward 
VII. <br/><br/>Hopkins was a strong supporter of the Union, unlike some Marylanders, who
sympathized with and often supported the South and the Confederacy.During the 
Civil War, Clifton became a frequent meeting place for local Union sympathizers, 
and federal officials.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Hopkins' support of Abraham Lincoln also often put him
at odds with some of Maryland's most prominent people, particularly Supreme 
Court Justice Roger B. Taney, who continually opposed Lincoln's presidential 
decisions, such as his policies of limiting habeas corpus and stationing troops 
in Maryland.<br/><br/> In 1862 Hopkins wrote a letter to Lincoln requesting the President
not to heed the detractors' calls and continue to keep soldiers stationed in 
Maryland. Hopkins also pledged financial and logistic support to Lincoln, in 
particular the free use of the B&amp;O railway system.</span></p>
