entrepreneur, and angel investor. He developed Napster, one of the first popular 
peer-to-peer ("P2P") file sharing platforms, in 1999. The popularity of Napster 
was widespread and Fanning was featured on the cover of Time magazine.<br />
<br />
The site in its initial free P2P incarnation was shut down in 2001 after the 
company's unsuccessful appeal of court orders arising from its encouraging the 
illegal sharing of copyrighted material. A paid subscription version of the site 
followed, and was purchased by Rhapsody on December 1, 2011. Following his 
involvement with Napster, he joined, and invested in, a number of early-stage 
technology startup companies.<br/><br/>
On June 1, 1999, Fanning released a preliminary beta program of Napster and 
soon, hundreds of college students at Northeastern were trading music furiously.<br />
<br />
In 2002, Fanning was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 
100 innovators in the world under the age of 35 In 2003, he opened a new 
company, Snocap, along with Jordan Mendelson (Napster's Chief Architect), and 
Ron Conway. <br/><br/>The company aspired to be a legitimate marketplace for digital
media. However, their partners and the public did not respond well. Customer 
support was poor, and technical issues were numerous. One of their primary 
partners, CD Baby, wrote a scathing account of their relationship.In late 2007, 
Snocap laid off 60% of its workforce. ValleyWag wrote an article that Fanning 
had long left Snocap and began to work on another venture, Rupture. <br/><br/>The
ValleyWag article stated that the failure was largely due to Snocap's CEO Rusty 
Rueff and that of former CTO Dave Rowley, who "made a mess of engineering before 
he was fired".Snocap was looking to sell itself and fast. In 2008, they found a 
buyer; imeem acquired Snocap in a fire sale.<br />
<br />

The Rupture project was announced in 2007 with seed funding, and CrunchBase 
notes the date Shawn officially became CEO of Rupture was October 2, 2007.<br />
<br />
In December 2006, Fanning developed Rupture, a social networking tool designed 
to handle the task of publishing gamers' individual profiles to a communal space 
and facilitating communication between World of Warcraft players. Rupture was 
later acquired by Electronic Arts for $15 million.Fanning's career at Electronic 
Arts was short-lived as a round of layoffs in November 2009 included him and his 
team at Rupture.<br />
<br />
A few months after Fanning was laid off from Electronic Arts, he started a new 
company called Path.com. In January 2010, Dave Morin announced he was leaving 
Facebook, where he was a Senior Platform Manager, to join Fanning and become CEO 
at Path.<br />
<br />
In 2011 Fanning reunited with Napster cofounder Sean Parker to found 
Airtime.com. Some of the investors are Ron Conway, Michael Arrington, and Ashton 
Kutcher. Fanning serves as CEO and Parker as executive chairman.<br />
<br />
Airtime launched in June 2012 at a disastrous public event where Parker and 
Fanning paid huge amounts of money to have celebrities present but the product 
repeatedly crashed and ultimately failed to work. Criticism was widespread and 
harsh on Twitter and other social media while numerous news outlets covered the 
fail with snarky comments such as CNET's "To launch his new start-up, Sean 
Parker should have spent less of his billions on celebrity guests and more of it 
on fixing his technology," <br />
<br />
In 2000, Fanning appeared as a presenter at the MTV Video Music Awards. He 
appeared wearing a Metallica T-shirt with "For Whom the Bell Tolls" playing in 
the background, and when asked where he got it, stated, "a friend of mine shared 
it with me." Lars Ulrich's reaction was shown as feigned boredom.<br />
<br />
In October 2000, Fanning was featured on the cover of Time magazine.<br />
<br />
In 2003, Fanning had a cameo appearance, playing himself, in the 2003 film The 
Italian Job. In the film, Seth Green's character Lyle accused Fanning of 
stealing Napster from him while he was taking a nap in their Northeastern 
University dorm room. Although other characters see this as mere bragging, a 
scene shows Fanning in fact creeping over Lyle's sleeping body and stealing a 
3-1/2" floppy disk.<br />
<br />
In early 2008, Fanning appeared in a Volkswagen commercial directed by Roman 
Coppola, in which he poked fun at his file-sharing past.<br />
<br />
Fanning and his site Napster were the subject of Alex Winter's documentary 
Downloaded in 2013.</p>
