    D'Aloisio was born in London, England in 1995 to Lou Montilla, a vice
president at UK Morgan Stanley and Diana D'Aloisio, a lawyer.<br />
<br />
Shortly after D'Aloisio was born, the family moved to Australia where they 
resided in Perth. The family returned to the United Kingdom when D'Aloisio was 
seven and he grew up in London. <br/><br/>He was a student at the predominantly male
private school King's College School&nbsp; in Wimbledon, London, where he 
received an academic scholarship. He lives in London, with his mother, father 
and younger brother Matthew, 15.<br />
<br />
Having completed his A level exams in Summer 2014, he now is a student at Oxford 
University, whilst still fulfilling his duties as Product Manager on Yahoo News 
Digest on the side.
<br />
<br />
D'Aloisio created the Trimit application for iOS in March 2011, which used an 
analytical tool to condense text content into 1000, 500, or 140-character 
summary text. <br/><br/>The app caught the attention of Apple who featured Trimit as a new
and noteworthy application on the App Store at the same time. The potential of 
Trimit attracted the attention of a billionaire, who provided D'Aloisio with 
US$300,000 in venture capital funding.<br/><br/> D'Aloisio used the feedback and criticism
from Trimit to completely re-design the application, and re-launched it in 
December 2011, as Summly.<br />
<br />
Summly aimed to solve perceived problems with the way news articles are 
presented on smartphones, with the initial version of Summly being downloaded by 
over 200,000 users. As a result of the corporate support, in November, 2012, 
D'Aloisio received US$1,000,000 in new venture funding for Summly from several 
international celebrities such as Yoko Ono, Ashton Kutcher and Stephen Fry, in 
addition to Hong Kong business mogul Li Ka-shing. <br/><br/>As of March, 2013, Summly was
sold to Yahoo for a reported $30 million US dollars.<br />
<br />
Summly's cover page images were created by visual artist/photographer Kevin 
Abosch.<br />
<br />
D'Aloisio completed a first round of venture capital funding for Summly from 
Horizons Ventures. He is the youngest person in the world to raise venture 
capital.<br />
<br />
According to Wall Street Journal, ".. he contracted a team of Israeli coders who 
specialize in natural language processing...". He also hired scientist Inderjeet 
Mani, "a retired professor who'd written seminal books on the topic. He became 
our main scientist", said D'Aloisio.<br />
<br />
