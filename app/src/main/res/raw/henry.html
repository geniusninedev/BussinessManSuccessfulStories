    Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist, the
founder of the Ford Motor Company, and the sponsor of the development of the 
assembly line technique of mass production.<br />
<br />
Although Ford invented neither the automobile nor the assembly line, he 
developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle class Americans 
could afford. In doing so, Ford converted the automobile from an expensive 
curiosity into a practical conveyance that would profoundly impact the landscape 
of the 20th Century. His introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized 
transportation and American industry.<br/><br/> As the owner of the Ford Motor Company, he
became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited 
with "Fordism": mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for 
workers. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace.<br/><br/> His
intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical 
and business innovations, including a franchise system that put dealerships 
throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents. Ford 
left most of his vast wealth to the Ford Foundation and arranged for his family 
to control the company permanently.<br />
<br />
Ford was also widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War 
I, and for promoting antisemitism through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent 
and the book The International Jew.<br/><br/>
In 1891, Ford became an engineer with the Edison Illuminating Company. After his 
promotion to Chief Engineer in 1893, he had enough time and money to devote 
attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines.<br/><br/> These experiments
culminated in 1896 with the completion of a self-propelled vehicle which he 
named the Ford Quadricycle. He test-drove it on June 4. After various test 
drives, Ford brainstormed ways to improve the Quadricycle.<br />
<br />
Also in 1896, Ford attended a meeting of Edison executives, where he was 
introduced to Thomas Edison. Edison approved of Ford's automobile 
experimentation. Encouraged by Edison, Ford designed and built a second vehicle, 
completing it in 1898.<br/><br/> Backed by the capital of Detroit lumber baron William H.
Murphy, Ford resigned from the Edison Company and founded the Detroit Automobile 
Company on August 5, 1899. However, the automobiles produced were of a lower 
quality and higher price than Ford wanted. Ultimately, the company was not 
successful and was dissolved in January 1901.<br />
<br />
With the help of C. Harold Wills, Ford designed, built, and successfully raced a 
26-horsepower automobile in October 1901. With this success, Murphy and other 
stockholders in the Detroit Automobile Company formed the Henry Ford Company on 
November 30, 1901, with Ford as chief engineer.<br/><br/>In 1902, Murphy brought in Henry
M. Leland as a consultant; Ford, in response, left the company bearing his name. 
With Ford gone, Murphy renamed the company the Cadillac Automobile Company.<br />
<br />
Teaming up with former racing cyclist Tom Cooper, Ford also produced the 80+ 
horsepower racer "999" which Barney Oldfield was to drive to victory in a race 
in October 1902. Ford received the backing of an old acquaintance, Alexander Y. 
Malcomson, a Detroit-area coal dealer. <br/><br/>They formed a partnership, "Ford &amp;
Malcomson, Ltd." to manufacture automobiles. Ford went to work designing an 
inexpensive automobile, and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a 
machine shop owned by John and Horace E. Dodge to supply over $160,000 in parts. 
Sales were slow, and a crisis arose when the Dodge brothers demanded payment for 
their first shipment.</p>
