    Although she initially planned to become an attorney, she reconsidered after
placing very low on the Law School Admission Test; she instead accepted a job at 
Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, where she worked for three months. She 
also occasionally worked as a stand-up comedian during this period.<br />
<br />
After her short stint at Disney, Blakely accepted a job with office supply 
company Danka, where she sold fax machines door-to-door. She was quite 
successful in sales and was promoted to national sales trainer at the age of 25. 
Forced to wear pantyhose in the hot Floridian climate for her sales role, 
Blakely disliked the appearance of the seamed foot while wearing open-toed 
shoes, but liked the way that the control-top model eliminated panty lines and 
made her body appear firmer.For her attendance at a private party, she 
experimented by cutting off the feet of her pantyhose while wearing them under a 
new pair of slacks and found that the pantyhose continuously rolled up her legs, 
but she also achieved the desired result(the original pants are now enshrined at 
Spanx headquarters).<br />
<br />
At age 27, Blakely relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, and while still working at 
Danka, spent the next two years and $5,000 savings researching and developing 
her hosiery idea. Upon inquiring, she found that there were no female patent 
lawyers operating in the entire state of Georgia. Unwilling to spend the 
$3,000-$5,000 quoted in legal fees, she instead wrote her own patent after 
purchasing a textbook from Barnes &amp; Noble.<br />
<br />
Blakely then drove to North Carolina, the location of most of America's hosiery 
mills, to present her idea. She was turned away by every representative; these 
companies were used to dealing with established companies, and did not see the 
value of her idea. Two weeks after arriving home from her North Carolina trip, 
Blakely received a call from a male mill operator based in Asheboro, North 
Carolina, who offered to support Blakely's concept, as he had received strong 
encouragement from his three daughters. Blakely further explained in 2011 that 
the experience of developing her idea also revealed to her that the hosiery 
manufacturing industry was overseen solely by men who were not using the 
products they were producing.<br />
<br />
The creation of the initial product prototype was completed over the course of a 
year and involved Blakey, her mother and her friends personally testing the 
garments; this was considered innovative at the time, as the industry did not 
test products with people. Blakely's research revealed that the industry had 
previously been using the same-size waistband for all hosiery products to cut 
costs, and a rubber cord was also inserted into the waistband. For her product 
development, Blakely created different waistbands to suit different-sized 
consumers.<br />
<br />
Blakely then returned to a patent attorney to finalize her application prior to 
her submission to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and he 
agreed to assist Blakely for a sum of US$750.<br/><br/> Following the submission of the
online application, Blakely then worked on the packaging of her product, which 
she intended to be bold and colored red, as the other brands at the time were 
all packaged in "beige, white or grey," and displayed the same type of female 
model. In addition to coloring her packaging red, Blakely used three animated 
images of different-looking women, which was also novel at the time. In terms of 
the other information that is displayed on hosiery packaging, Blakely bought 10 
different product brands from a department store to use as a guide.<br />
<br />
Requiring a brand name for her product, Blakely was frustrated after not being 
able to settle on a title she was satisfied with after about a year-and-a-half 
of ideation. At the time of finalizing a brand name, Blakely knew that Coca-Cola 
and Kodak were the two most recognized brand names in the world, with both 
containing a strong "k" sound. <br/><br/>Blakely read that the founder of Kodak liked the
sound so much that he used it as the beginning and end of his brand name and 
then proceeded to create a functioning word based upon this foundation. Blakely 
had also been informed by comedian friends that the "k" sound is a trade secret 
to ensure laughter from an audience. Then, while sitting in traffic, the name 
"Spanks" came to Blakely and she decided shortly afterwards that she would 
replace the "ks" with an "x", as her research had shown that constructed names 
were more successful and were also easier to register as a trademark. Blakely 
then used her credit card to purchase the "Spanx" trademark on the USPTO website 
for US$150.<br />
<br />
Blakely managed to arrange a meeting with a representative of the Neiman Marcus 
Group, at which she changed into the product in the ladies restroom in the 
presence of the Neiman Marcus buyer to prove the benefits of her 
innovation.Blakely's product was sold in seven Neiman Marcus stores as a result 
of the meeting; Bloomingdales, Saks, and Bergdorf Goodman soon followed. At 
around this time, Blakely sent a basket of products to Oprah Winfrey's 
television program, with a gift card that explained what she was attempting to 
develop</p>
