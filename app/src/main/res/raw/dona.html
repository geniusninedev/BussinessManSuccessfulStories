    Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman, politician
and President-elect of the United States. His presidential transition is 
underway, and he is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2017. At 70 years 
old, he will be the oldest person to assume the presidency.<br />
<br />
Trump was born and raised in the Queens borough of New York City and received a 
bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of 
Pennsylvania in 1968. In 1971 he took control of his family's real estate and 
construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump 
Organization. During his career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous 
office towers, hotels, casinos and golf courses.<br/><br/> Various other products and
activities bear his name. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 
1996 to 2015, and has made cameo appearances in films and television series. 
From 2004 to 2015, Trump hosted and co-produced The Apprentice, a reality 
television series on NBC. As of 2016, he was listed by Forbes as the 324th 
wealthiest person in the world, and 113rd in the United States, with a net worth 
of $4.5 billion.<br />
<br />
Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew 
before voting began. He also floated the idea of running as a Republican for the 
2012 election but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his 
candidacy for the 2016 election.<br/><br/> His platform includes renegotiating U.S.–China
trade deals, opposing "unfair" trade agreements such as NAFTA and the 
Trans-Pacific Partnership, pursuing energy independence using all energy sources 
while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the 
Paris Agreement, strongly enforcing immigration laws, building a wall along the 
Mexico–U.S. border, reforming veterans' affairs, replacing Obamacare with a 
cheaper alternative, abolishing the Common Core education standards, investing 
in the country's infrastructure and simplifying the tax code with lower rates.<br />
<br />
Trump quickly emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 
contenders. His final rivals suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July 
he was formally nominated at the party convention.<br/><br/> Trump won the general
election on November 8, 2016, by earning more Electoral College votes than 
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who won the popular vote. Trump's 2016 
presidential campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international 
attention. Some of his statements in interviews and at campaign rallies have 
been controversial or false. <br/><br/>Several rallies during the primaries were
accompanied by protests, while more nationwide protests followed his election to 
the Presidency.<br />
Trump played himself as the Plaza Hotel owner in a cameo appearance in the movie 
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992).<br/><br/> He also appeared as a guest in many films
and series such as: The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, The Job, Suddenly Susan, Sex 
and the City, The Drew Carey Show, Two Weeks Notice, Spin City, The Nanny, The 
Associate, The Little Rascals, Zoolander and Eddie.<br />
<br />
You've Been Trumped (2011), a documentary film by Anthony Baxter, follows 
Trump's efforts to develop a Scottish golf resort When it was announced that the 
documentary was to premiere on BBC Two television in the UK, on October 21, 
2012, Trump's lawyers contacted the BBC to demand that the film should not be 
shown, saying that it was defamatory and misleading.<br/><br/> The screening went ahead,
with the BBC defending the decision and stating that Trump had refused the 
opportunity to take part in the film. He appeared with Rudy Giuliani in his 
documentary Giuliani Time.<br />
<br />
Funny or Die released a parody film called Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: 
The Movie (2016)</p>
