    Robert Edward "Ted" Turner III (born November 19, 1938) is an American media
mogul and philanthropist. As a businessman, he is known as founder of the Cable 
News Network (CNN), the first 24-hour cable news channel. In addition, he 
founded WTBS, which pioneered the superstation concept in cable television.<br />
<br />
As a philanthropist, he is known for his US$1 billion gift to support the United 
Nations, which created the United Nations Foundation, a public charity to 
broaden domestic support for the UN. Turner serves as Chairman of the United 
Nations Foundation board of directors. Additionally, in 2001, Turner co-founded 
the Nuclear Threat Initiative with U.S. Senator Sam Nunn (D-GA). NTI is a 
non-partisan organisation dedicated to reducing global reliance on, and 
preventing the proliferation of, nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. He 
currently serves as Co-Chairman on the Board of Directors.<br />
<br />
Turner's media empire began with his father's billboard business, Turner Outdoor 
Advertising, which he took over in 1963 after his father's suicide.It was worth 
$1 million. His purchase of an Atlanta UHF station in 1970 began the Turner 
Broadcasting System. CNN revolutionized news media, covering the Space Shuttle 
Challenger disaster in 1986 and the Persian Gulf War in 1991.<br/><br/> Turner turned the
Atlanta Braves baseball team into a nationally popular franchise and launched 
the charitable Goodwill Games. He helped revive interest in professional 
wrestling by buying World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and starting the Monday 
Night Wars in 1995, airing Monday Nitro on his TNT head-to-head against the 
World Wrestling Federation's Monday Night Raw on USA.<br />
<br />
Turner's penchant for controversial statements earned him the nicknames "The 
Mouth of the South" and "Captain Outrageous". Turner has also devoted his assets 
to environmental causes. He was the largest private landowner in the United 
States until John C. Malone surpassed him in 2011.<br/><br/> He uses much of his land for
ranches to re-popularize bison meat (for his Ted's Montana Grill chain), 
amassing the largest herd in the world. He also created the environmental-themed 
animated series Captain Planet and the Planeteers</p>
