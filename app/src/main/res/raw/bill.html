	William Henry "Bill" Gates III (born October 28,
1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author and philanthropist. In 
1975, Gates and Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft, which became the world's 
largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the 
positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, and was the largest 
individual shareholder until May 2014. Gates has authored and co-authored 
several books.<br/><br/>

Starting in 1987, Gates was included in the Forbes
list of the world's wealthiest people and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 2007, 
again in 2009, and has been since 2014. Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth 
doubled from US$40 billion to more than US$82 billion.Between 2013 and 2014, his 
wealth increased by US$15 billion. Gates is currently the richest person in the 
world, with an estimated net worth of US$81.7 billion as of November 2016.<br/><br/>

Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the
personal computer revolution. Gates has been criticized for his business 
tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion that has in 
some cases been upheld by numerous court rulings. Later in his career Gates 
pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to 
various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the 
Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, established in 2000.<br/><br/>

Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of
Microsoft in January 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of 
chief software architect for himself. In June 2006, Gates announced that he 
would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work, and 
full-time work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He gradually transferred 
his duties to Ray Ozzie (chief software architect) and Craig Mundie (chief 
research and strategy officer). Ozzie later left the company. Gates' last 
full-time day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008.He stepped down as chairman of 
Microsoft, in February 2014, taking on a new post as technology adviser to 
support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.<br/><br/>

At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private
preparatory school. When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers Club at the 
school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 
33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer 
for the school's students.<br/><br/>Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in
BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his 
first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that 
allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the 
machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he 
reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the 
machine." After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students 
sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was 
a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four 
Lakeside students – Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans – for the 
summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain 
free computer time.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
At the end of the ban, the four students offered to
find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the 
system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for 
various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, 
and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the 
company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. 
hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in Cobol, providing 
them computer time and royalties. <br/><br/>After his administrators became aware of his
programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule 
students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with 
"a disproportionate number of interesting girls."He later stated that "it was 
hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously 
demonstrate success." At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called 
Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor. In 
early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of 
Representatives</span></p>
