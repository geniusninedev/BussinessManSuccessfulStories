	Kamen is best known for inventing the product that
eventually became known as the Segway PT, an electric, self-balancing human 
transporter with a computer-controlled gyroscopic stabilization and control 
system. The device is balanced on two parallel wheels and is controlled by 
moving body weight. The machine's development was the object of much speculation 
and hype after segments of a book quoting Steve Jobs and other notable IT 
visionaries espousing its society-revolutionizing potential were leaked in 
December 2001.<br/><br/>

Kamen was already a successful and wealthy inventor,
after inventing the first drug infusion pump and starting a company, 
AutoSyringe, to market and manufacture the pump. His company DEKA also holds 
patents for the technology used in portable dialysis machines, an insulin pump 
(based on the drug infusion pump technology), and an all-terran electric 
wheelchair known as the iBOT, using many of the same gyroscopic balancing 
technologies that later made their way into the Segway.<br/><br/>

During his career Kamen has won numerous awards. He
was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1997 for his biomedical 
devices and for making engineering more popular among high school students. In 
1999 he was awarded the 5th Annual Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and 
Employment, and in 2000 received the National Medal of Technology from then 
President Clinton for inventions that have advanced medical care worldwide. In 
April 2002, Kamen was awarded the Lemelson-MIT Prize for inventors, for his 
invention of the Segway and of an infusion pump for diabetics. In 2003 his 
"Project Slingshot," a cheap portable water purification system, was named a 
runner-up for "coolest invention of 2003" by Time magazine.<br/><br/>

In 2005 he was inducted into the National Inventors
Hall of Fame for his invention of the AutoSyringe. In 2006 Kamen was awarded the 
"Global Humanitarian Action Award" by the United Nations. In 2007 he received 
the ASME Medal, the highest award from the American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers,in 2008 he was the recipient of the IRI Achievement Award from the 
Industrial Research Institute, and in 2011 Kamen was awarded the Benjamin 
Franklin Medal in Mechanical Engineering of the Franklin Institute.<br/><br/>

Kamen received an honorary "Doctor of Engineering"
degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute May 17, 1996, a "Doctor of 
Engineering" degree from Kettering University in 2001, an honorary "Doctor of 
Science" degree from Clarkson University on May 13, 2001, an honorary "Doctor of 
Science" degree from the University of Arizona on May 16, 2009, and an honorary 
doctorate from the Wentworth Institute of Technology when he spoke at the 
college's centennial celebration in 2004, and other honorary doctorates from 
North Carolina State University in 2005, Bates College in 2007, the Georgia 
Institute of Technology in 2008, the Illinois Institute of Technology in 2008 
and Plymouth State University in May 2008. In 2015, Kamen received an honorary 
"Doctor of Engineering and Technology" degree from Yale University.<br/><br/>

Kamen received the prestigious Stevens Honor Award on
November 6, 2009, given by the Stevens Institute of Technology and the Stevens 
Alumni Association. On November 14, 2013, he received the James C. Morgan Global 
Humanitarian Award.<br/><br/>

His residence is a hexagonal, shed style mansion he
dubbed Westwind,located in Bedford, New Hampshire, just outside Manchester. The 
house has at least four different levels and is very eclectically conceived, 
with such things as hallways resembling mine shafts, 1960s novelty furniture, a 
collection of vintage wheelchairs, spiral staircases and at least one secret 
passage, an observation tower, a fully equipped machine shop, and a huge 
cast-iron steam engine which once belonged to Henry Ford built into the center 
atrium of the house (which is actually small in comparison), which Kamen is 
working to convert into a Stirling engine-powered kinetic sculpture. Kamen owns 
and pilots an Embraer Phenom 300 light jet aircraft and three Enstrom 
helicopters, including a 280FX, a 480, and a 480B.He regularly commutes to work 
via his helicopters and had a hangar built into his house. In 2016 he piloted a 
B-2 Spirit bomber at Whiteman AFB, marking the opening of the 2016 FRC World 
Championship in St. Louis.<br/><br/>

He is the main subject of Code Name Ginger: the Story
Behind Segway and Dean Kamen's Quest to Invent a New World, a nonfiction 
narrative book by journalist Steve Kemper published by Harvard Business School 
Press in 2003 (released in paperback as Reinventing the Wheel).<br/><br/>

His company, DEKA, annually creates intricate
mechanical presents for him. The company has created a robotic chess player, 
which is a mechanical arm attached to a chess board, and a vintage-looking 
computer with antique wood, and a converted typewriter as a keyboard. In 
addition, DEKA has received funding from DARPA to work on a brain-controlled 
prosthetic limb called the Luke Arm.<br/><br/>
