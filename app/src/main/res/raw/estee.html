	The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder 
	began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four 
	products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and 
	Creme Pack. <br/><br/>Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department
	store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.<br />
	<br />
	Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their 
	products in the United States. <br/><br/>In 1960, the company started its first
	international account in the London department store Harrods. The following 
	year it opened an office in Hong Kong.<br />
	<br />
	In 1964, they started Aramis Inc., designed by Arame Yeranyan, with the 
	fragrance named after Yeremes - a city in Armenia, producing fragrances and 
	grooming products for men. In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of 
	ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and 
	financial editors.<br/><br/> This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from
	Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that 
	year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. 
	Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy 
	tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder.<br />
	<br />
	Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to 
	introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line 
	called "Skin Supplies for Men", which continues to be sold at Clinique 
	counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the 
	Soviet Union.<br />
	<br />
	In February 2004, the company's teen-oriented jane business was sold; in 
	April 2006, the professional-quality Stila brand, which Estée Lauder 
	purchased in 1999, was sold.<br />
	<br />
	The company has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to 
	simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce 
	Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, 
	Carolyn Murphy, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008 the main 
	spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda.<br/><br/> In 2010, the
	company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto 
	Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski. Their first 
	campaigns will come out June 2010, and will be shot by Craig McDean.<br />
	<br />
	As of 2010, Estée Lauder sold its products in department stores across the 
	world and has a chain of freestanding retail outlets. On July 1, 2010, the 
	company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in 
	Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California by brothers Dean and Davis 
	Factor (as in Max)<br /><br/>
	In October 1992, the BCA campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's 
	daughter in law) who co-created the "Pink Ribbon" with SELF magazine as a 
	symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard 
	the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can 
	save lives. <br/><br/>The Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness
	campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder 
	Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research 
	Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law 
	created BCRF's signature pink ribbon.<br />
	<br />
	Over $10 million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation 
	between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1 million were raised from their 
	retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003.<br />
