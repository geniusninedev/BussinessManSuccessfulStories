    Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson (born 18 July 1950) is an English
business magnate, investor and philanthropist. He founded the Virgin Group, 
which controls more than 400 companies.<br />
<br />
Branson expressed his desire to become an entrepreneur at a young age. At the 
age of sixteen his first business venture was a magazine called Student. In 
1970, he set up a mail-order record business. In 1972, he opened a chain of 
record stores, Virgin Records, later known as Virgin Megastores. Branson's 
Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he set up Virgin Atlantic airline 
and expanded the Virgin Records music label.<br />
<br />
In March 2000, Branson was knighted at Buckingham Palace for "services to 
entrepreneurship". For his work in retail, music and transport (with interests 
in land, air, sea and space travel), his taste for adventure, and for his 
humanitarian work, he became one of the most prominent figures in British 
culture.In 2002 he was named in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. In 
July 2015, Forbes listed Branson's estimated net worth at US $5.2 billion.<br/><br/>
Branson was born in Blackheath, London, the eldest of three children of Eve 
Branson (née Evette Huntley Flindt; born 1924), a former ballet dancer and air 
hostess, and Edward James Branson (1918–2011), a barrister. Branson has two 
younger sisters. His grandfather, the Right Honourable Sir George Arthur Harwin 
Branson, was a judge of the High Court of Justice and a Privy Councillor. 
Branson was educated at Scaitcliffe School, a prep school in Berkshire, before 
briefly attending Cliff View House School in Sussex.<br/><br/> His third
great-grandfather, John Edward Branson, left England for India in 1793. His 
father, Harry Wilkins Branson, later joined him in Madras. Through 
intermarriage, Branson is part Indian. Branson attended Stowe School, an 
independent school in Buckinghamshire until the age of sixteen.<br/><br/>Branson has
dyslexia and had poor academic performance as a student, and on his last day at 
school, his headmaster, Robert Drayson, told him he would either end up in 
prison or become a millionaire. Branson's parents were supportive of his 
endeavours from an early age.<br/><br/>
Branson started his record business from a church where he ran Student magazine. 
Branson interviewed several prominent personalities of the late 1960s for the 
magazine including Mick Jagger and R. D. Laing. Branson advertised popular 
records in The Student and it was an overnight success.<br/><br/> Trading under the name
"Virgin", he sold records for considerably less than the "High Street" outlets, 
especially the chain W. H. Smith. Branson once said, "There is no point in 
starting your own business unless you do it out of a sense of frustration." The 
name "Virgin" was suggested by one of Branson's early employees because they 
were all new at business. At the time, many products were sold under restrictive 
marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 
1960s to limit so-called resale price maintenance</p>
