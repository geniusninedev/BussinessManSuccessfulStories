    Steve Wozniak was born in San Jose, California, the son of Margaret Elaine
(Kern) and Jacob Francis "Jerry" Wozniak. He is of Polish and Swiss-German 
ancestry. His father was from Bukovyna, Ukraine (Poland at the time) and his 
mother from German-Swiss background. The family immigrated to US. <br/><br/>
The name on Wozniak's birth certificate is "Stephan Gary Wozniak", but Steve's 
mother said that she intended it to be spelled "Stephen", and "Steve" is what he 
uses.<br />
<br />
Wozniak has been referred to frequently by the nickname "Woz", "The Wonderful 
Wizard of Woz", "The Second Steve", or "The Woz" "WoZ" (short for "Wheels of 
Zeus") is also the name of a company Wozniak founded. The city of San Jose named 
a street "Woz Way" in his honour.<br />
<br />
In the early 1970s, Wozniak was also known as "Berkeley Blue" in the phone 
phreak community, after he made a blue box.<br />
<br />
In 1969, Wozniak returned to the Bay Area after being expelled from University 
of Colorado Boulder in his first year for hacking into the institution's 
computer system. He later re-enrolled at De Anza College and transferred to 
University of California, Berkeley in 1971.<br/><br/> Before focusing his attention on
Apple, he was employed at Hewlett-Packard where he designed calculators. It was 
during this time that he befriended Steve Jobs.<br />
<br />
Steve Wozniak was introduced to Jobs by friend Bill Fernandez, who attended 
Homestead High School with Jobs in 1971. Jobs and Wozniak became friends when 
Jobs worke d for the summer at Hewlett-Packard (HP), where Wozniak too was
employed, working on a mainframe computer. This was recounted by Wozniak in a 
2007 interview with ABC News, of how and when he first met Steve Jobs:<br />
<br />
"We first met in 1971 during my college years, while he was in high school. A 
friend said, 'you should meet Steve Jobs, because he likes electronics and he 
also plays pranks.' So he introduced us.</p>
