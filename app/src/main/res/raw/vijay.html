    Vijay Mallya is an Indian businessman and politician. The son of businessman
Vittal Mallya, he is the ex-chairman of United Spirits Ltd, the largest spirits 
company in India and continues to serve as Chairman of UB Group, an Indian 
conglomerate with interests in beverage alcohol, aviation infrastructure, real 
estate and fertiliser among others. He has been the Chairman of Sanofi India 
(previously Hoechst AG and Aventis) as well as the Chairman of Bayer CropScience 
in India for over 20 years, in addition to being the Chairman of several other 
companies.He recently announced that he shall retire from the chairmanship of 
Sanofi India.<br />
<br />
Once called the "King of Good Times" due to his extravagant lifestyle, Mallya 
and his companies have been embroiled in financial scandals, and controversies 
since 2012. Mallya left India on 2 March 2016 after saying he wanted to move to 
Britain to be closer to his children. A group of 17 Indian banks are trying to 
collect approximately 9,000 crore (US$1.3 billion) in loans which Mallya has 
allegedly routed to gain 100% or a partial stake in about 40 companies across 
the world. Investigative agencies, such as Income Tax Department and the Central 
Bureau of Investigation for charges including financial fraud and money 
laundering, and the Attorney General said that Mallya's assets abroad are "far 
in excess to loans taken by him".The 17 banks petitioned the Supreme Court of 
India in March 2016 to try to prevent Mallya from leaving the country, but the 
Indian government indicated that he had already left. The Enforcement 
Directorate of India also filed a money laundering case against him in March 
2016 for allegedly sending abroad some 900 crore (US$130 million) that had been 
loaned to his airline. On 24 April 2016, the Ministry of External Affairs 
(India) revoked Mallya's passport, and he resigned from the Rajya Sabha on 2 May 
2016, the day before the Ethics Committee of the Rajya Sabha was prepared to 
recommend his expulsion. Currently the Enforcement Directorate is seeking 
Interpol to raise an international arrest warrant against Mallya. Also, the High 
Court of Judicature at Hyderabad issued a non-bailable warrant against Mallya on 
13 March 2016 for his failure to appear in the court regarding an allegation of 
cheating the GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd by issuing them a 
dishonoured cheque for 50 lakh (US$74,000).<br />

Mallya also co-owns the Formula One team Sahara Force India. His companies own 
Indian Premier League team Royal Challengers Bangalore, the I-League teams Mohun 
Bagan AC and East Bengal FC. He is also a member of the World Motor Sport 
Council representing India in the FIA. He is also known for having launched 
Kingfisher Airlines, an airline established as a major business venture in 2005 
that later became insolvent and was shut down in 2012. Mallya also served in the 
Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India, for his home state 
Karnataka.</p>
