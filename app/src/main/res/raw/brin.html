<span class="auto-style1">Brin was born in Moscow in the Soviet Union, to
Russian Jewish parents, Yevgenia and Mikhail Brin, both graduates of Moscow 
State University (MSU). His father is a mathematics professor at the University 
of Maryland, and his mother a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.<br/><br/>

In May 1979, when Brin was five years old, his family
felt compelled to emigrate out of the Soviet Union.In an interview with Mark 
Malseed, co-author of The Google Story, Sergey's father explained how he was 
"forced to abandon his dream of becoming an astronomer even before he reached 
college." He said "Communist Party heads barred Jews from upper professional 
ranks by denying them entry to universities, Jews were excluded from the physics 
department, in particular, at the prestigious Moscow State University, because 
Soviet leaders did not trust them with nuclear rocket research." Mikhail Brin 
therefore changed his major to mathematics where he received nearly straight 
A's. In another interview with Dominic Lawson of The Independent, Mikhail said: 
"No one would consider me for graduate school because I was Jewish." He went on 
to tell Lawson how MSU required Jews to take their entrance exams in different 
rooms from non-Jewish applicants, and how they were marked on a harsher scale.<br/><br/>

The Brin family lived in a three-room apartment in
central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother.Brin 
told Malseed, "I've known for a long time that my father wasn't able to pursue 
the career he wanted", but Brin only picked up the details years later after 
they had settled in the United States. In 1977, after his father returned from a 
mathematics conference in Warsaw, Poland, Mikhail Brin announced that it was 
time for the family to emigrate. "We cannot stay here any more", he told his 
wife and mother. At the conference, he was able to "mingle freely with 
colleagues from the United States, France, England and Germany and discovered 
that his intellectual brethren in the West were not 'monsters.'" He added, "I 
was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave."<br/><br/>

Sergey's mother was less willing to leave their home
in Moscow, where they had spent their entire lives. Malseed writes, "For Genia, 
the decision ultimately came down to Sergey. While her husband admits he was 
thinking as much about his own future as his son's, for her, 'it was 80/20' 
about Sergey." They formally applied for their exit visa in September 1978, and 
as a result his father was "promptly fired". For related reasons, his mother 
also had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, 
they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request 
would be denied as it was for many refuseniks. During this time his parents 
shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself 
computer programming. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas 
and were allowed to leave the country. At an interview in October 2000, Brin 
said, "I know the hard times that my parents went through there and am very 
thankful that I was brought to the States."<br/><br/>

In the summer of 1990, a few weeks before his 17th
birthday, his father led a group of high school math students, including Sergey, 
on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Union. His roommate on the trip was 
future Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor John Stamper. As 
Brin recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he 
remembered that "his first impulse on confronting Soviet oppression had been to 
throw pebbles at a police car." Malseed adds, "On the second day of the trip, 
while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took 
his father aside, looked him in the eye and said, 'Thank you for taking us all 
out of Russia.<br/><br/>

Brin attended elementary school at Paint Branch
Montessori School in Adelphi, Maryland, but he received further education at 
home; his father, a professor in the department of mathematics at the University 
of Maryland, encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him 
retain his Russian-language skills. He attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School in 
Greenbelt, Maryland. In September 1990 Brin enrolled in the University of 
Maryland, where he received his Bachelor of Science from the Department of 
Computer Science in 1993 with honors in computer science and mathematics, which 
is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and 
Natural Sciences.<br/><br/>

Brin began his graduate study in computer science at
Stanford University on a graduate fellowship from the National Science 
Foundation. In 1993, he interned at Wolfram Research, the developers of 
Mathematica. As of 2008 he was on leave from his PhD studies at Stanford</span></p>
