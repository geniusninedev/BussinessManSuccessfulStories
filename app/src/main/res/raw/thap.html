    Gautam Thapar belongs to the
third generation of the business family founded by his grandfather Karam Chand 
Thapar, in Kolkata. Karam Chand had initially offered the reins of the family 
business to Gautum's father, Brij Mohan Thapar, bypassing his oldest son Inder 
Mohan Thapar. However, Brij Mohan passed on the chance to his younger brother 
Lalit Mohan Thapar, giving lack of desire and inability to shoulder the 
responsibility as the reasons.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Gautam was educated at The
Doon School. He then studied chemical engineering at Pratt Institute in the 
United States. When he failed to find a suitable job and found his US visa 
running out, Gautam returned to India.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Gautam Thapar began his
career as a factory assistant in a manufacturing unit of the erstwhile Thapar 
Group. At this time, Lalit Mohan (a lifelong bachelor), had been grooming Inder 
Mohan Thapar's son Vikram as his successor. However, Gautam gained Lalit Mohan's 
attention, and rose rapidly through the ranks. He first turned around the 
Group's ailing company, Andhra Pradesh Rayons (APR). Then, he nurtured the group 
company BILT's new export oriented businesses – leather, shoes and foods. Gautam 
didn't like the group's management style, and made his dissent clear. Impressed 
with him, Lalit Mohan gave him the responsibility to turn around the BILT's 
chemical division, which was suffering losses due to labour agitations and 
shortage of water and power. Gautam showed profits within a year, by scrapping 
the company's expansion plans, selling off a few assets and dealing firmly with 
the labour.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    The family's assets were
divided into four in 1999, with Gautaum's older brother Karan parting ways in 
2005. Gautam became the Chairman of Crompton Greaves on 22 July 2004. When Lalit 
Mohan Thapar retired, he chose Gautam over Vikram.In 2005, he handed over the 
reins of the business empire to Gautam, along with his voting rights, shares and 
most of his personal effects in his will.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Gautam Thapar became the
Chairman of the Group on 1 July 2006. He is now on the Board of several 
companies in India and abroad.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Gautam Thapar is President
of Thapar University and former Chairman of the Ananta Aspen Centre. He is also

over as the chairman of the board of governors of the Mumbai-based business 
school NITIE, for a 4-year period.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
