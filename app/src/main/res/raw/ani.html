	Anita Roddick opened the first Body Shop in 1976
with the aim of making an income for herself and her two daughters while her 
husband was away in South America, with the idea of providing quality skin care 
products in refillable containers and sample sizes, all marketed with truth 
rather than hype. She opened her second shop six months later. On her husband's 
return, he joined the business. By 1991, the Body Shop had 700 branches, and 
Roddick was awarded the 1991 World Vision Award for Development Initiative.In 
1993 she told Third Way Magazine:<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
"The original Body Shop was a series of brilliant
accidents. It had a great smell, it had a funky name. It was positioned between 
two funeral parlours—that always caused controversy. It was incredibly sensuous. 
It was 1976, the year of the heat wave, so there was a lot of flesh around. We 
knew about storytelling then, so all the products had stories. We recycled 
everything, not because we were environmentally friendly, but because we didn't 
have enough bottles. It was a good idea. What was unique about it, with no 
intent at all, no marketing nous, was that it translated across cultures, across 
geographical barriers and social structures. It wasn't a sophisticated plan, it 
just happened like that. ”<br/><br/>

In 1997, Anita developed the Body Shop's most
successful campaign ever, creating Ruby, the size 16 doll, who was thought to 
bear a passing resemblance to Barbie. The campaign evolved from a new strategic 
positioning developed by ethical communications consultancy Host Universal, who 
created the image of the naked red-haired doll, hands behind her head and wind 
in her hair, that became the embodiment of the campaign. The photographer was 
Steve Perry.<br/><br/>

By 2004, the Body Shop had 1980 stores, serving over
77 million customers throughout the world. It was voted the second most trusted 
brand in the United Kingdom, and 28th top brand in the world.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
On 17 March 2006, L'Oréal purchased Body Shop for £652
million. This caused controversy, because L'Oréal is involved in animal testing 
and because the company is part-owned by Nestlé, which has been criticised for 
its treatment of third world producers. Anita Roddick addressed it directly in 
an interview with The Guardian, which reported that "she sees herself as a kind 
of 'Trojan horse' who by selling her business to a huge firm will be able to 
influence the decisions it makes. Suppliers who had formerly worked with the 
Body Shop will in future have contracts with L'Oréal, and whilst working with 
the company 25 days a year Roddick was able to have an input into decisions.<br/><br/>

to be confused with Andy Roddick Foundation.<br/><br/>
Roddick was known for her campaigning work on
environmental issues and was a member of the Demos think tank's advisory 
council. Children on the Edge (COTE) is an organisation that Roddick founded in 
1990, in response to her visits to Romanian orphanages.<br class="auto-style1" />

Upon seeing the conditions the children were in, she
created COTE to help manage the crisis and worked to de-institutionalise the 
children over the course of their early life. COTE's mission is to help 
disadvantaged children affected by conflicts, natural disasters, disabilities, 
and HIV/AIDS.<br/><br/>

On 13 December 2005, the National Post reported that
Roddick had decided to turn her back on the world of commerce and give away her 
fortune, which came to £51 million ($104 million).<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Roddick also wrote the book Take It Personally, which
encourages equality and an end to the exploitation of workers and children in 
underdeveloped countries.<br/><br/>

After her death her husband, Gordon Roddick, founded
38 Degrees in her memory, explaining, "I knew what would make Anita really laugh 
would be to cause a lot of trouble."<br/><br/>

The Anita Roddick Foundation has given four grants
totalling £120,000 to CAGE, a controversial organization aiming "to raise 
awareness of the plight of the prisoners at Guantánamo Bay and other detainees 
held as part of the War on Terror" . The organization has been described as "a 
front for Taliban enthusiasts and al Qaida devotees that fraudulently presents 
itself a human rights group", connected to Jihadi John and closely tied to Anwar 
al-Awlaki</span></p>
