him left him and ran away. Prem had no local acquaintances or knowledge of the 
language. Out of pity, a fellow Tamilian guided him to a temple and appealed 
worshipers to contribute money for his return ticket to Chennai. <br/><br/>
Prem refused to go back and decided to work in Mumbai and started cleaning 
utensils in a restaurant. He appealed to his owner, to let him become a waiter 
as he was class 10 pass. The owner refused, because of regional politics and 
Prem bided his time till a neighbor hood dosa restaurant opened and offered him 
a job from a dishwasher to a tea boy. <br/><br/>

Prem became a huge hit with the customers because of his excellent customer 
service, initiatives and relationship and brought business Rs. 1000 daily which 
was almost 3 times as compared to other tea boys. The life was good. <br/><br/>
A customer made him an offer. He was planning to open a tea shop in Vashi in 
Mumbai. He wanted Prem to be his 50 – 50 partner where the owner would invest 
the money while Prem would run the shop. <br/><br/>The shop started doing brisk business
when the owner became greedy. It hurt him to share 50 % of the profit with Prem 
and he threw Prem out replacing him with an employee. <br/><br/>
Prem was made of a different material and he was never going to be defeated. He 
took a small loan from his uncle and with his brother, opened his own tea stall. 
Unfortunately the neighbourhood residents objected. He then started a hand cart 
but that also did not work out.<br/><br/> He found a spot and set up a south Indian stall.
He did not know a thing about dosas and idli but learnt by observation, trial 
and error. The dosa stall was a huge hit and flourished during the 5 years from 
1992-1997.<br/><br/> But why was the tiny dosa stall was was so successful in spite of
competition from ubiquitous eateries prevalent in Mumbai. According to Prem it 
was its hygiene, proper appearances of the waiters and fresh ingredients which 
stood out as a difference. <br/><br/>
He saved a couple of lakhs of Rupees and instead of heading home he took the 
biggest risk of his life and opened a new shop near Vashi station and named it 
as Dosa Plaza.<br/><br/> His Chinese plaza next to the Dosa Plaza flopped miserably and
was shut down in 3 months. Undaunted, Prem realized some lessons from it. He 
applied those lessons in making Chinese cuisine in his dosas which worked very 
well. <br/><br/>
He got passionate and invented a variety of dosas with Chinese style like 
American Chopsuey, Schezwan Dosa, Paneer chilly, Spring roll dosa etc. The 108 
types of Dosas in his menu gets him a lot of publicity.<br/><br/>
A chance encounter with a customer who was part of the team setting up a food 
court in a mall in New Bombay advised him to take a stall at the food court and 
again Prem was ready and willing to grow and expand. His vision was to grow by 
better offerings and better customer service. He also went to ad agencies to 
create the brand identity including the logo, brands, menu card, waiters dress 
etc. <br/><br/>
He started getting a lot of offers for franchising and had to find out the 
meaning of franchising and its modus operandi. Dosa Plaza currently has 26 
outlets and 5 of them are company owned.<br/><br/> It has 150 employees and a turnover of
5 crore. All the branches are connected and networked and there are training 
managers and proper manuals to maintain standard and uniform product and 
services. <br/><br/>
Merit is the only criteria; all the employees regardless of the caste or region 
are treated equally. They are loyal and have grown with the company. <br/><br/>The
original team of cooks which was the part of the first Dosa venture is still 
with Prem. Currently he is also getting enquiries from US and Europe for 
franchisees.</p>
