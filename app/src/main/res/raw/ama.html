	Amadeo Pietro Giannini was born in San Jose,
California, to Italian immigrant parents. He was the first son of Luigi Giannini 
(1840–1877) and Virginia (Demartini) Giannini (1850–1920). Luigi Giannini 
immigrated to the United States from Favale di Malvaro near Genoa, Liguria in 
the Kingdom of Sardinia (later part of Italy) to prospect in response to the 
California Gold Rush of 1849. Luigi continued in gold during the 1860s and 
returned to Italy in 1869 to marry Virginia, bringing her back to the US and 
settling in San Jose. Luigi Giannini purchased a 40-acre farm at Alviso in 1872 
and grew fruits and vegetables for sale. Four years later Luigi Giannini was 
fatally shot by an employee over a pay dispute. His widow Virginia, with two 
children and pregnant with a third child, took over operation of the produce 
business. In 1880, Virginia married Lorenzo Scatena (1859–1930) who began L. 
Scatena &amp; Co. (which A.P. Giannini would eventually take over). Giannini 
attended Heald College but realized he could do better in business than at 
school. In 1885, he dropped out and took a full-time position as a produce 
broker for L.Scatena &amp; Co.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
	Giannini worked as a produce broker, commission
merchant and produce dealer for farms in the Santa Clara Valley. He was quite 
successful in that business. He married Clorinda Cuneo (1866–1949), daughter of 
a North Beach real estate magnate, in 1892 and eventually sold his interest to 
his employees and retired at the age of 31 to administer his father-in-law's 
estate. He later became a director of the Columbus Savings &amp; Loan, in which his 
father-in-law owned an interest. At the time, banks were run for the benefit of 
the wealthy and the well-connected. Giannini observed an opportunity to service 
the increasing immigrant population that were without a bank. At loggerheads 
with the other directors who did not share his sentiment, he quit the board in 
frustration and started his own bank. <br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
	Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco on
October 17, 1904. The bank was housed in a converted saloon as an institution 
for the "little fellow". It was a new bank for the hardworking immigrants other 
banks would not serve. He offered those ignored customers savings accounts and 
loans, judging them not by their wealth, but by their character. Deposits on 
that first day totaled $8,780. Within a year, deposits soared above $700,000 
($13.5 million in 2002 dollars). The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fires 
leveled much of the city. In the face of widespread devastation, Giannini set up 
a temporary bank, collecting deposits, making loans, and proclaiming that San 
Francisco would rise from the ashes.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
	Immediately after the earthquake, he moved the vault's
money to his home outside the fire zone in then-rural San Mateo, 18-miles by 
horse and wagon. The money was moved in a garbage wagon, owned by Hayward 
resident Giobatta Cepollina, also a native of Italy (Loano). The cargo was 
disguised beneath garbage to protect against theft. The fires severely heated 
the vaults of other big banks. Opening them immediately would ruin the money, so 
they were kept closed for weeks. Because of this, Giannini was one of the few 
who were able to provide loans. Giannini ran his bank from a plank across two 
barrels in the street. Giannini made loans on a handshake to those interested in 
rebuilding. Years later, he would recount that every loan was repaid. As further 
testament to the trust Giannini garnered in the local community, as a reward to 
the local garbage man for helping to transport the bank's reserves, Giannini 
agreed to give the man's son his first job with the bank when he came of age. 
Giannini kept his promise, hiring young Frank Joseph Cepollina at age 14. 
Cepollina later retired from the bank at age 41.<br/><br/><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
	Branch banking was introduced by Giannini shortly
after 1909 legislation in California that allowed for branch banking in the 
state. Its first branch outside San Francisco was established in 1909 in San 
Jose. By 1916, Giannini had expanded and opened several other branches. Giannini 
believed in branch banking as a way to stabilize banks during difficult times as 
well as expand the capital base. He bought banks throughout California and 
eventually Bank of Italy had hundreds of branches throughout the state.</span></p>
