    Michael Rubens "Mike" Bloomberg(born February 14, 1942) is an American
business magnate, politician, and philanthropist. His net worth is estimated at 
US$42.7 billion, as of October 2016, ranking him as the 6th richest person in 
the United States and the 8th richest person in the world.<br />
<br />
Bloomberg is the founder, CEO, and owner of Bloomberg L.P., the global financial 
data and media company that bears his name, and is notable for its Bloomberg 
Terminal, which is widely used by investment professionals around the world. He 
began his career at the securities brokerage Salomon Brothers, before forming 
his own company in 1981 and spending the next twenty years as its Chairman and 
CEO. Bloomberg also served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees at his alma 
mater, Johns Hopkins University, from 1996 to 2002.<br />
<br />
Bloomberg served as the 108th Mayor of New York City, holding office for three 
consecutive terms, beginning with his first election in 2001. A Democrat before 
seeking elective office, Bloomberg switched his party registration in 2001 to 
run for Mayor as a Republican. <br/><br/>He defeated opponent Mark Green in a close
election held just weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks. He won a 
second term in 2005, and left the Republican Party two years later. Bloomberg 
campaigned to change the city's term limits law, and was elected to his third 
term in 2009 as an Independent candidate on the Republican ballot line.<br />
<br />
Bloomberg was frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for the U.S. 
Presidential elections in 2008, and 2012, as well as for Governor of New York in 
2010. He declined to seek either office, opting to continue serving as the Mayor 
of New York City.<br />
<br />
On January 1, 2014, Bill de Blasio succeeded Bloomberg as the Mayor of New York 
City. After a brief stint as a full-time philanthropist, Bloomberg re-assumed 
the position of CEO at Bloomberg L.P. by the end of 2014.<br/><br/> On March 7, 2016,
Bloomberg announced that he would not run as a third party candidate in the 2016 
U.S. presidential election despite widespread speculation that he would, and 
later endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for president.</p>
