    Eugene Charles Albert Sharrer was a British subject by naturalisation but of
German descent, who was a leading entrepreneur in what is now Malawi for around 
fifteen years between his arrival in 1888 and his departure. He rapidly built-up 
commercial operations including wholesale and retail trading, considerable 
holdings of land, cotton and coffee plantations and a fleet of steamers on the 
Zambezi and Shire rivers.<br/><br/> Sharrer was prominent in pressure groups that
represented the interests of European planters and their businesses to the 
colonial authorities, and was responsible for the development of the first 
railway in what had become the British Central Africa Protectorate, whose 
construction was agreed in 1902.<br/><br/> In 1902, Sharrer consolidate all his business
interests into the British Central Africa Company Ltd and became its principal 
shareholder Shortly after this he left British Central Africa permanently for 
London, although he retained his financial interests in the territory. Very 
little is known of his history before he arrived in Central Africa but he died 
in London during the First World War.<br/><br/>
Very little is known about the early life of Eugene Sharrer, except that he was 
by origin a German from Hamburg and claimed to be a British subject by 
naturalisation. He was described as of Jewish appearance, if not of Jewish 
origin, by a colonial official and became an archetypal colonial outsider, 
financially successful but disliked by officials because of his national and 
ethnic origins.<br/><br/> He arrived in what is today Malawi in 1888, before the country
had become a British protectorate, with a consignment of trade goods and he 
initially joined forces with John Buchanan who had been trading there since 
1881, but soon started trading on his own account. <br/><br/>Sharrer was involved in the
trade in ivory, until 1893 the main export product of the area, and from this 
trading venture there developed the wholesale and retail Kubula Stores Ltd. When 
the ivory trade declined as the elephants were killed off, he diversified, 
acquiring considerable landholdings and building up a successful transport and 
agricultural concern.<br/><br/> Kubula Stores Ltd failed to compete with the rural network
of "Mandala" village stores of the African Lakes Company and was sold to this 
rival in the 1920s<br />
<br />
Although a British consul was resident in Central Africa from 1883, as late as 
1888 the British Foreign Office declined to accept responsibility to protect the 
tiny British settlements there.<br/><br/> Sharrer claimed to have purchased 363,034 acres
in the area, and had attempted to induce chiefs to give up all their rights to 
their land. He may have intended to form his own Chartered company, or as Harry 
Johnston who was appointed as British consul in 1891 suspected, to acquire a 
form of sovereignty over the Shire Highlands and sell his rights either to 
Britain or Germany.<br/><br/> Johnston rejected the suggestion that any treaties made
before the British Central Africa Protectorate was established in 1891 could 
transfer sovereignty to Sharrer, but he accepted that these treaties were 
evidence of sales of land to him</p>
