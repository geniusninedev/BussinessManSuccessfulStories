	Kamprad was born in Pjätteryd (now part of Älmhult
Municipality), Sweden. He was raised on a farm called Elmtaryd (presently 
standardized Älmtaryd) near the small village of Agunnaryd in Ljungby 
Municipality in the province of Småland. His paternal grandfather was from 
Germany, but moved the family to Sweden.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Kamprad began to develop a business as a young boy,
selling matches to neighbors from his bicycle. He found that he could buy 
matches in bulk very cheaply from Stockholm, sell them individually at a low 
price, and still make a good profit. From matches, he expanded to selling fish, 
Christmas tree decorations, seeds, and later ballpoint pens and pencils. When 
Kamprad was 17, his father gave him a cash reward for succeeding in his studies.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
IKEA was founded in 1943 at Kamprad's uncle Ernst's
kitchen table. In 1948, Kamprad diversified his portfolio, adding furniture. His 
business was mostly mail-order. The acronym IKEA is made up of the initials of 
his name (Ingvar Kamprad) plus those of Elmtaryd, the family farm where he was 
born, and the nearby village Agunnaryd.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
In June 2013, Kamprad resigned from the board of Inter
IKEA Holding SA and his youngest son Mathias Kamprad replaced Per Ludvigsson as 
the chairman of the holding company. Following his decision to step down, the 
then-87-year-old founder explained, ”I see this as a good time for me to leave 
the board of Inter IKEA Group. By that we are also taking another step in the 
generation shift that has been ongoing for some years.” Mathias and his two 
older brothers, who also have leadership roles at IKEA, work on the 
corporation's overall vision and long-term strategy<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
According to Swedish business weekly Veckans Affärer,
Kamprad is one of the world's wealthiest people. This report is based on the 
assumption that Kamprad owns the entire company, an approach both IKEA and the 
Kamprad family reject. Kamprad retains little direct ownership in the company, 
having transferred his interest to Stichting INGKA Foundation and INGKA Holding 
as part of a complex tax sheltering scheme that leaves his actual degree of 
control vague.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
In March 2010, Forbes magazine estimated Kamprad's
fortune at US$23 billion, making him the eleventh richest person in the world. A 
year later, he fell to 162nd after his lawyers produced documents proving that 
the foundation he established and heads in Liechtenstein owns IKEA, and that its 
bylaws bar him and his family from benefiting from its funds. In June 2015, 
Kamprad was listed as the eighth wealthiest person in the world in the Bloomberg 
Billionaires Index, with an estimated net worth of $43.2 billion.Forbes reported 
Kamprad's net worth as of February 2016 to be $3.4 billion.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
While generally a private person, Kamprad has
published a few notable works. He first detailed his philosophies of frugality, 
simplicity and enthusiasm in a manifesto entitled A Testament of a Furniture 
Dealer. Written in 1976, it is considered the fundamental ideology of the IKEA 
retail concept, and its values are integrated into all of IKEA's activities.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Kamprad also worked with Swedish journalist Bertil
Torekull on Leading by Design: The IKEA Story. In the autobiographical book, 
Kamprad further describes his philosophies and the trials and triumphs of the 
founding of IKEA.<br/><br/>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Many stories about Kamprad are a part of his heritage.
When he talks to IKEA staff at different locations, his main theme is often 
management by example, and he uses himself as an example. He always flies 
economy class, sits in second-class train cars when possible, and never stays at 
expensive hotels.</span></p>
