	Ferrari was born on 18 February 1898 in Modena,
Italy. His birth certificate had recorded his birth date on 20 February because 
a heavy snowstorm had prevented his father from reporting the birth at the local 
registry office. He was the younger of two children to Alfredo and Adalgisa 
Ferrari (née Bisbini), after his elder sibling Alfredo Junior (Dino). Alfredo 
Senior was the son of grocer from Carpi and started a workshop fabricating metal 
parts at the family home.Enzo grew up with little formal education.<br/><br/> At the age
of 10 he witnessed Felice Nazzaro's win at the 1908 Circuit di Bologna, an event 
that inspired him to become a racing driver. During World War I he was assigned 
to the third Alpine Artillery division of the Italian Army. His father Alfredo, 
as well as his older brother, Alfredo Jr., died in 1916 as a result of a 
widespread Italian flu outbreak. Ferrari became severely sick himself in the 
1918 flu pandemic and was consequently discharged from Italian service.<br/><br/>

Following the family's carpentry business collapse,
Ferrari started searching for a job in the car industry. He unsuccessfully 
volunteered his services to FIAT in Turin, eventually settling for a job as 
test-driver for C.M.N. (Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali), a Milan-based car 
manufacturer which redesigned used truck bodies into small passenger cars.<br/><br/> He
was later promoted to race car driver and made his competitive debut in the 1919 
Parma-Poggio di Berceto hillclimb race, where he finished fourth in the 
three-litre category at the wheel of a 2.3-litre 4-cylinder C.M.N. 15/20. On 
November 23 of the same year, he took part in the Targa Florio but had to retire 
after his car's fuel tank developed a leak.<br/><br/>

The prancing horse emblem was created when Italian
fighter pilot Francesco Baracca was shot down during World War I. Baracca gave 
Enzo Ferrari a necklace with the prancing horse on it prior to takeoff. Baracca 
was tragically shot down and killed. <br/><br/>In memory of his death, Enzo Ferrari used
the prancing horse to create the emblem that would become the world famous 
Ferrari shield. However the world first saw this emblem on an Alfa Romeo as 
Ferrari was still tied up with Alfa Romeo. It was not until 1947 that the shield 
was first seen on a Ferrari. This was the birth of Ferrari.<br/><br/>

In 1924 Ferrari won the Coppa Acerbo at Pescara, a
success that encouraged Alfa Romeo to offer him a chance to race in much more 
prestigious competitions. Deeply shocked by the death of Antonio Ascari in 1925, 
Ferrari turned down the opportunity to focus instead on the management and 
development of the factory Alfa cars, eventually building up a team of over 
forty drivers, including Giuseppe Campari and Tazio Nuvolari. Ferrari himself 
continued racing until 1932, before he left Alfa Romeo to found Scuderia 
Ferrari.<br/><br/>

Alfa Romeo agreed to partner Ferrari's racing team
until 1933, when financial constraints forced them to withdraw their support – a 
decision subsequently retracted thanks to the intervention of Pirelli. Despite 
the quality of the Scuderia drivers, the team struggled to compete with Auto 
Union and Mercedes. Although the German manufacturers dominated the era, 
Ferrari's team achieved a notable victory in 1935 when Tazio Nuvolari beat 
Rudolf Caracciola and Bernd Rosemeyer on their home turf at the German Grand 
Prix.<br/><br/>

In 1937 Alfa Romeo decided to regain full control of
its racing division, retaining Ferrari as Sporting Director. Unhappy with the 
arrangement, Ferrari left and founded Auto-Avio Costruzioni, a company supplying 
parts to other racing teams. Although a contract clause restricted him from 
racing or designing cars for four years, Ferrari managed to manufacture two cars 
for the 1940 Mille Miglia, driven by Alberto Ascari and Lotario Rangoni.<br/><br/> With
the outbreak of World War II in 1943, Ferrari's factory was forced to undertake 
war production for Mussolini's fascist government. Following Allied bombing of 
the factory, Ferrari relocated from Modena to Maranello. At the end of the 
conflict, Ferrari decided to start making cars bearing his name, and founded 
Ferrari S.p.A. in 1947.</span></p>
